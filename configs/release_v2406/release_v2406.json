        "context": "Andrei Zubov is a portfolio manager for Greenhill Trust based in Connecticut. Greenhill provides a range of wealth advisory and institutional client services. Zubov is preparing to meet with three new clients.CHM Corporation is a US based company that manufactures sports equipment. The company’s employees participate in a defined contribution plan in which investments in the plan is participant directed. Greenhill has been asked to develop an Investment Policy Statement for the plan and help select a menu of investment options for plan participants.Jennifer Zola is a member of the investment committee for the defined benefit pension plan for GIC Products, a company that manufactures beauty, healthcare and homecare products. The company’s pension assets are currently managed in- house and Zola would like Greenhill to assume management of their pension assets. Selected information regarding the company and its pension plan is provided in Exhibit 1. <image_1>\n\nZola asks Zubov, “Based on the information provided could you give us some preliminary guidance on an appropriate return objective?” Zubov responds, “In this instance, a return objective of up to 100 basis points higher than the liability discount rate would be appropriate. This return objective would not only help the plan fund pension obligations but potentially minimize future pension obligations and maintain or increase future pension income.”\nZola also provides the following additional information:\n■■\nthe company has enjoyed steadily rising earnings for the past 10 years andexpects this trend to continue in the future\n■■\nthe company has debt to total assets of approximately 10 percent\n■■\nthe company would like to discuss the possibility of modifying the currentpension plan by offering an early retirement provision allowing for lump-sumdistributions\nZola asks Zubov to explain his overall approach to pension asset risk management.Zubov explains that there are two important considerations, “The first consideration is portfolio allocations to different sectors. Specifically, the plan’s risk tolerance will be higher if we overweight the pension portfolio with equity investments in companies in the beauty, healthcare, and homecare industry. The second consideration is to view risk from an asset liability management approach. That is, the focus should be on managing the volatility of the pension surplus.”\nThe Hoven University (HU) has asked Greenhill to manage the university’s endowment. The endowment’s spending rule dictates that it makes an annual contribution of 4% of its year-end portfolio market value to support HU’s operating budget. The annual endowment contribution represents 25% of HU’s annual operating budget. The university’s operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate of 2.5% annually, while the rate of inflation in the economy is expected to be 1% per year. Investment management expenses are estimated to be 0.65% of the market value of the endowment.\n\nThe investment committee has asked Zubov to provide his views on the risk and return objectives and liquidity constraints for the endowment. Zubov responds with the following statements:\n■■\n“Based on the information provided, an annual total return objective in therange 7% to 7.5% would be appropriate for the fund.\n■■\nIn order to meet the endowment’s spending needs for this year, the liquidityneed is in the range 4.5% to 5% of the year-end portfolio value.\n■■\nGiven the return objective and liquidity needs, the endowment’s risk toleranceis high.”",

This justifies a more aggressive return objective in excess of the liability discount rate of 5% by up to 100 basis points. Furthermore, this desired return objective will likely help meet other objectives such as minimizing future pension obligations and maintaining or increasing future pension income.",

        "context": "Martin Standish is an economic analyst with Exeter Asset Management, a British firm that specializes in global funds for institutional investors, most of whom are based in the United Kingdom. Standish is identifying potential countries and asset classes to include in a developed markets fund that Exeter intends to introduce later this year. He begins his work by collecting macroeconomic data with which he can assess the outlook and expectations for a set of investment opportunities he is considering. Standish observes the following data: <image_1>\n\n\nDeeba Kumar, Standish’s supervisor, stops by to see how his work is progressing. She asks him to research at least five additional countries for the new fund, and suggests Chile, Singapore, Great Britain, the United States and Denmark as potential candidates. She cautions Standish that he needs to be aware of interest rate linkages between these economies, and mentions three points that he should consider:\n1 Since the Chilean peso appears to be undervalued relative to the British pound and is likely to rise, Chilean bond yields may be lower than they should be relative to British bonds.\n2 The peg linking Denmark’s currency to the euro is considered to be at risk and likely to break. Therefore, Danish bond yields are expected to drop if the Danish krone weakens relative to the euro.\n3 After removing expected inflation, the real bond yield is likely to be similar in Singapore and Sweden.\nNext, Standish begins to identify specific assets to include in the developed markets portfolio. He considers equally weighted positions in Chilean Real Estate, Swiss bonds, and US equities, among others. He reviews the forecasts of inflation for these three countries and notes that inflation is predicted to be above expected levels in Chile, but below expectations in both Switzerland and the United States. With this new information, he ponders how he should adjust the portfolio weights to reflect the economic forecast.\nExeter also manages an emerging markets fund. Standish has been asked to help Mary Jones, a new trainee, review the country risk associated with assets in that fund. Standish tells Jones that the evaluation process is similar to the evaluation of assets in developed countries, but with more emphasis on several key factors. Jones responds that her country risk analysis will focus on the balance of payments, debt level, and the political situation in each country.\nJones tells Standish that she is particularly concerned about currency risk in the emerging markets fund. She is worried that the fund’s positions in Thailand may be at risk if there is a change in the value of the Thai baht (THB) relative to the British pound (GBP). Jones has gathered some projections (Exhibit 2) to assist her in analyzing the risk; she believes that Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) should provide a good model for esr1marmg any currency change.\n\n<image_2>\n\nJones and Standish discuss her estimate. Standish mentions that PPP can be combined with a relative economic strength forecast for a more complete analysis, and suggests to her that there are at least three strengths to the combined approach:\n1 PPP provides a useful guide to the short-term direction of exchange rates;\n2 Relative economic strength focuses on trade flows, so it is independent of short-term interest rates;\n3 Relative economic strength captures the impact of news on the economy.",

Early Tuesday morning, she meets with a new client, Marjorie Sunnydale, to understand her financial history and objectives. Everitt mentions that she will be preparing an investment policy statement (IPS) for her. Marjorie says that one was prepared by her previous advisor, but that its purpose was not explained to her. The first question that Marjorie asks Everitt is what benefits an IPS might provide. Everitt prepares the following notes (Exhibit 1) as the meeting continues.\n\n\nAfter compiling the information in Exhibit 1, Everitt concludes that Marjorie has a low risk tolerance.\nAs they continued their Tuesday meeting, Marjorie asks Everitt to determine whether she will be able to fund her immediate goals if she accepts King’s buyout offer.\nJust prior to ending their Tuesday meeting, Marjorie mentions that three months ago she met with Gardiner-Parkway Advisors (GPA), and they prepared an IPS for her. She said that she was not satisfied with their work and this is why she has sought out assistance from MIC. She mentions the following three statements that were included in GPA’s IPS:■\nMarjorie has a multi-stage time horizon: the first stage is four years, until herintended retirement, followed by a second stage of 22 years;■\nMarjorie intends to proceed with a planned donation to the engineering schoolfrom which she graduated, and there appears to be sufficient liquidity to meetthis goal;■\nCurrently, the sizable investment in Westmeyer shares provides both tax deferral and tax reduction benefits\n\n<image_1>\n<image_2>\n\nThe Thursday afternoon phone call\nOn Thursday afternoon, Everitt phones Marjorie to ask her to return to the office to sign-off on the IPS which she had just prepared. Marjorie indicates that in the intervening few days several important developments have taken place that need to be incorporated into her IPS:■\nFurther negotiations with King resulted in her immediately accepting an offer of$13,000 per share for all of her shares in SSE.■\nKing agreed to maintain her $150,000 salary only for the rest of the current yearduring which the planned transition will be completed.■\nMarjorie decided to accept a reduced pension of $100,000 per year, starting atage 60.■\nThe donation to the engineering school will now be increased to $3 million.■\nAnna’s education will now be funded immediately with a single contribution of$850,000 invested in the same way as the remainder of her portfolio.■\nMarjorie plans on transferring the Westmeyer shares to Anna at age 21, eitherdirectly or through a trust set up in her will. In either case, Anna will beinformed about her great-grandmother’s wishes concerning the shares, with thehope that they will continue to be honored. Should Anna not survive to age 21,the shares will be donated to the engineering school.\nMarjorie had indicated that she wished to have her investment portfolio structuredto limit shortfall risk (defined as expected real return minus two standard deviations) to be no lower than a negative 12% in any one year. Before revising Marjorie’s IPS for the new information, Everitt carries out additional research on expected future college costs and general inflation, and now estimates that Marjorie requires a real after-tax return of 5% p.a. to meet her future needs. She provides summary statistics for three asset allocation alternatives (Exhibit 2) that she thinks will satisfy Marjorie’s requirements.\n\n<image_3>",

She, and two of her colleagues, Peg Todd and Nat Filbert, have just joined the in-house pension investment committee which oversees the investment process for Stone’s defined-benefit plan. As a team, they will help the investment committee measure overall return, consider benchmarks and evaluate outside investment managers. Todd initiates a discussion of the use of benchmarks applicable to various fund managers including hedge funds.\n\n\nTodd:\n“We should match the passive and active managers with the appropriate security market index. Any benchmark or index we use should fit the specific needs of the sponsor (Stone Bancorp) rather than just the manager. Also, excluding the hedge funds, the indexes should be widely available.”\nFilbert:\n“An appropriate benchmark will have risks similar to that of an active manager’s portfolio allowing us to better identify and reduce active risk exposure. If the benchmark and manager risk levels are aligned, we are indifferent whether positive excess returns are achieved by skill or by luck.”\nMishum:\n“For active equity portfolios, we should at least be able to attribute returns to security selection or industry bets.”\nMishum’s team reviews report summaries of recent overall investment results of the pension plan account (Exhibit 1) and the performance of the equity managers (Exhibit 2). The account experienced significant cash flows only in April and December.\n\n<image_1>\n\nUsing the data in Exhibit 1, Filbert calculates an overall annual return of –2.2% while Mishum calculates a return of –1.8% for the year. The team verifies the return calculations and discusses why they differ:\nMishum:\n“When evaluating project returns with cash flows, I was taught to use the internal rate of return (IRR). It accounts for the cash flows yet is not influenced by their timing.”\nFilbert:\n“You have calculated the time-weighted rate of return (TWR), whereas I have calculated the money-weighted rate of return (MWR).”\nTodd:\n“The money-weighted return should exceed the time-weighted return because the cash flows occurred at favorable times.”\nThe team then considers the prior year’s investment performance of the equity managers.\n\n\nAfter reviewing the equity manager data in Exhibit 2, Todd comments that he is most impressed with the manager whose active return was the highest for those whose investment style was out of favor over the period.\nSix months later, Stone Bancorp announces a merger with another bank. When the deal closes, Stone will freeze and terminate the existing defined benefit pension plan. Employees will have access to a different plan with the new owner. The sponsor clarifies the pension obligations after these events as follows:\n■■\nNo new employees will be added to the plan and existing vested employees willno longer accrue additional benefits.\n■■\nCurrent retired beneficiaries will continue to receive their normal flat, monthlypayments. They do not have any option for a lump sum distribution.\n■■\nDue to expected terminations including certain highly compensated executives,lump-sum distributions within a year are estimated to be about 15% of thecurrent plan value.\n■■\nThe plan will be funded at 105% of ABO when terminated and no additionalfuture contributions are expected.\n■■\nActuaries identify the duration of estimated payouts excluding lump-sum distributions to be 14 years.\n■■\nThe estimated return necessary to meet the obligations of the plan is 3.9%.\nMishum, Filbert, and Todd evaluate Stone’s new situation and work toward settingup a new benchmark that will mimic the obligations and risk of the terminated plan going forward. The benchmark structure will drive the realignment of the investments.\nMishum:\n“We should design a benchmark that includes several bond funds, some inflation-sensitive securities, has a weighted average duration of 14 years, and sufficient liquidity to meet the lump sum payouts.”\nTodd:\n“I think we should identify a 3.9% required return as the primary objective since that estimate includes all of the expected payouts including inflation adjustments. We then select an assortment of asset classes that meet this required return while minimizing risk as much as possible.”\nFilbert:\n“Although you both make good points, the primary emphasis should be Sharpe style analysis. We should control investment risk using optimization procedures.”\n\n<image_2>",

        "context": "London-based Kingsbridge Partners has been selected to manage a GBP150 million global bond portfolio for a pension fund. Jonathan Bixby, Kingsbridge’s portfolio manager, meets with Iain Seymour, a fixed income analyst at the firm to review the portfolio and its holdings relative to the client’s objectives.\nThe pension fund allows the use of 100% leverage to generate incremental returns. Bixby evaluates the use of leverage in the portfolio using the data in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nBixby's current macro view is that the economy is growing at a rate above the trend rate and, as a result, interest rates are likely to rise. Given his view, he is concerned the duration of the portfolio is inappropriate and plans to use the futures market to manage its interest rate risk. His new duration target for the asset portfolio is 4.25, and he uses the data in Exhibit 2 to reposition the portfolio.\n\n<image_2>\n\nSeymour suggests to Bixby that as an alternative to futures he could use interest rate swaps or options to alter the portfolio’s duration. He says he can alter the duration by receiving fixed and paying floating on a swap. Seymour also suggests that buying a protective put will achieve the hedging objective but provides more upside if Bixby is wrong about the future direction of interest rates. He says Bixby can also express his view by writing a covered call and not incur the cost of the premium.\nSeymour tells Bixby, “International interest rates are not perfectly correlated. We can see the impact of a change in US interest rates on our model global bond portfolio. This portfolio contains US and German bonds and is not currently hedged with regard to currency or interest rates. Our analysis shows that the country beta between the United States and Germany is 0.62.” Model global bond portfolio data is provided in Exhibit 3.\n\n\n<image_3>\n\n\nBixby asks Seymour whether the model portfolio should be hedged back to its domestic currency, the pound sterling (GBP). Bixby tells him that actively managing currency risk is an expected source of incremental returns for the portfolio and has historically accounted for 25% of Kingsbridge’s alpha relative to the benchmark.Seymour refers to the data in Exhibit 4 to support his current view that currency exposure in the portfolio should be actively managed.\n\n<image_4>\n\nBixby asks whether this global portfolio would benefit from including emerging market debt securities. Seymour responds that returns can be attractive in emerging markets during certain periods, but risks also abound. He notes the following risks:\nRisk 1: Returns are frequently characterized by significant negative skewness because the potential large downside is not offset by a comparable upside.\nRisk 2: Emerging markets offer less protection from interference by the executive branch than developed countries.\nRisk 3: Emerging market countries have limited access to secondary sources of liquidity.",

In preparation, Gatchell meets with Anjou Lafite, another analyst at the fund, to review a relevant part of the endowment’s investment policy statement:\n“Funds will be invested in the most efficient vehicle that meets the investment objective. Each manager must demonstrate the efficiency with which the tracking error they take on delivers active return. In addition, each manager must consistently adhere to his stated style.”\nGatchell is given the task of reviewing three investment managers and selecting a manager that is most likely to adhere to Sonera’s investment policy statement. Information about the investment managers is found in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nGatchell is reviewing the fee structures proposed by the three investment managers. He finds the following reference in the investment policy statement:\n“The fee structure must be easy to understand and avoid undue complexity wherever possible. Also, the fee structure must be predictable, so Sonera can reasonably forecast these costs on a yearly basis as an input to the annual budgeting process.”\n\n\nPMHe understands there are many different fee structures, and he wants to make sure he chooses the most appropriate one for the Sonera Endowment Fund. He prepares a recommendation to the investment policy committee regarding the most appropriate fee structure.Sonera has followed an active investment style for many years. Gatchell would like to recommend to the investment policy committee that a portion of the funds be invested using a passive investment style. His research shows there are a number of methods used to weight the stocks in an index, each having its own characteristics. The one key feature he feels is important is that the method chosen not be biased towards small- capitalization stocks.Gatchell is also examining different ways to establish passive equity exposure. He states to Lafite, “There are a number of ways to get passive equity exposure; we can invest in an equity index mutual fund, a stock index futures contract, or a total return equity swap. Stock index futures and equity swaps are low- cost alternatives to equity index mutual funds; however, a drawback of stock index futures is they have to be rolled over periodically. One advantage of investing in equity mutual funds is that shares can be redeemed at any point during the trading day.”Gatchell is reviewing the performance of another investment manager, Far North, which employs a value- oriented approach and specializes in the Canadian market. Gatchell would like to recommend to the investment policy committee that the fund diversify geographically. The information for Far North and the related returns are found in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe investment policy committee reviews the information in Exhibit 2 and is not familiar with the terms true active return and misfit active return. Gatchell responds with the following statement:\n“The true active return is the return Far North made above its normal benchmark return. The misfit active return is the return Far North made above the investor’s benchmark return. The term investor’s benchmark refers to the benchmark the investor uses to evaluate performance for a given portfolio or asset class.”",

She is reviewing some of the trade requests the desk has received from its personal and institutional portfolio managers and is deciding on what tactics to recommend.\nAhmed starts by reviewing the trade requests from one of Tweed’s personal portfolio managers, Edwin Moore. She passes the requests along to Vladimir Norsk, one of the firm’s traders. The first trade Ahmed asks Norsk to execute is a purchase of 2,000 shares of BDF Ltd., which trades on the SEAQ, London’s dealer market for infrequently traded shares. Norsk reviews the current limit order book for BDF shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nNorsk was able to fill the order for BDF during the day by executing the trades shown in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe next request that Ahmed reviews is for the purchase of 300,000 shares of WWT pie from a client who is quite concerned about price execution. She reviews the trading volumes from the previous day (Exhibit 3) and, prepares her recommendation on the trade.\n\n<image_3>\n\nThe final order from Moore that Ahmed asks Norsk to execute is a purchase of 1,000 shares of JAK pie with a limit order of £25.00 good for the day.\nNorsk was unsuccessful in filling the limit order on the first day and after consultation with the client they agree to revise the price. Two days later Norsk successfully purchases 800 shares of JAK at £26.25 with commission costs of £135.00. Moore decides to cancel the order for the remaining 200 shares when the shares close that day at £26.75.\nMoore and Ahmed discuss the implementation shortfall from the investment in JAK, based on the $25.50 closing price in Exhibit 3, and Moore makes the following statement:\nI know that market movement is a factor in the implementation shortfall. Because market movement is beyond Norsk’s control, when assessing his performance, we should adjust the calculation to only include the commission costs and the missed trading opportunity for the 200 shares.",

        "context": "Kate Baker is in charge of assessing investment managers hired by KTB Funds. KTB states its investment strategy as being adept at investing in undervalued securities in equity and debt markets. Baker is assisted by Trent Coates and Gerry Manders. The group are examining the performance (Exhibit 1) of three managers who separately specialize in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap equities.\nIn addition to overall return, Baker reminds the group that they also need to focus on whether the managers have been consistent with KTB’s investment strategy.\n\n<image_1>\nGiven the under-performance of the small-cap fund, Baker and her assistants examine the investments being made in that fund. The fund holdings are primarily in stocks that trade infrequently and seldom have dealer quotes. Consequently, there is a concern that the small-cap benchmark may be inappropriate.\nCoates suggests using a custom security-based benchmark that has the following criteria:\n1 broadly representative of the small-cap market,\n2 includes a cash position weighting, and\n3 weighted according to the market capitalization of infrequently traded small cap stocks.\nBaker and her assistants then turn their attention to the large-cap manager’s performance. The large-cap benchmark is viewed as being representative of the market portfolio that is used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Upon gathering more information (Exhibit 2), they want to assess whether the large-cap manager is skillful based on the generation of ex-post alpha relative to the CAPM and having a ratio of active return relative to active risk being above 0.10.\n\n<image_2>\nManders suggests using a performance quality control chart to assess the large-cap manager. He makes the following statements to support his point:\n■■\nsuch a chart utilizes a confidence band that widens with the time horizon.\n■■\na skillful manager only needs to outperform the benchmark regularly with deviation within the confidence band.\n■■\nthe analysis is based on three criteria: 1) an initial testable null hypothesis thatthe manager has no investment skill, 2) an assumption that value-added returnsare normally distributed and independent from period to period, and 3) anassumption that the manager’s investment process is consistent from period toperiod.\nThe group now turns its attention to three bond funds in which KTB holds positions (Exhibit 3). Similar to KTB’s equity strategy, the bond strategy is one of being adept at finding undervalued debt securities.\n\n<image_3>\nCoates asks Baker. “Given all of the assessment we are performing on equity and bond managers, what are the consequences of firing a manager?”\nBaker answers, “The expense of frequent manager turnover is only of concern if we commit Type 2 errors. However, we should also be concerned with discontinuing the services of skillful managers solely based on our quantitative assessment metrics, which is an example of a Type I error. Consequently, in addition to quantitative assessment, we should also interview the fund manager face-to-face before either deciding to retain or terminate him or her, just as was done at the initial hire.”",

        "context": "Edvard Richards is president and sole owner of More Than Lumber Corporation (MTL), a privately held building materials company. Founded by the Richards family, the company has been run by Edvard Richards for over 40 years. Richards also owns investment real estate in the form of a warehouse unrelated to MTL, as well as 70,000 common shares of publicly traded Cintas (CTAS) that he inherited. He wants these two items to be considered concentrated positions.\nNow 68, Richards is seeking advice on how to transition to retirement. He provides information about his holdings (Exhibit 1) to two competing financial advisers, Todd Adams and Linda Boshe:\n\n<image_1>\n\nRichards asks each adviser to apply a goal-based planning framework he has read about that uses three risk buckets: personal, market, and aspirational. As a first step, he estimates his own after-tax primary capital assuming that all assets are sold today and converted into cash. He asks the two advisers to assess his after-tax primary capital under the same assumptions (all three estimates are provided in Exhibit 2).\n\n<image_2>\n\n\nRichards wants to monetize and eliminate the concentration risk of his CTAS holding without paying taxes on capital gains and then invest the proceeds in a balanced portfolio. He notes the following comments in his discussions with the two advisers:\n\nRichards: “My broker says he can arrange a cashless collar against CTAS or a short sale against the box. I understand that both methods will avoid incurring an immediate capital gain and both will expose me to the same level of market risk. I can borrow against the position in both cases and offset the cost of borrowing with the CTAS dividends.”\nAdams: “We could help you complete a short against the box transaction. This strategy will provide a high loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and avoid counterparty risk. A total return equity swap has these same advantages. You can thus realize the economic gain on CTAS while deferring capital gains taxes.”\nBoshe: “We suggest either a forward conversion with options or an equity forward sale. Either will achieve high LTV ratio monetization without incurring immediate capital gains taxes, and both methods avoid counterparty risk.”\nAdams has strong connections to the real estate market and informs Richards that the market value estimate of $3 million for the warehouse is much too low. He advises Richards to consider reducing his real estate risk directly by, using the immediate cash inflows, net of tax liabilities and costs, to increase his stock and bond portfolios. Adams is confident he can arrange any of the following real estate offers:\n1. Sell the warehouse for $4.8 million to an outside investor.\n2. Enter into a recourse mortgage loan with the warehouse valued at $5.8 million by the lender and an LTV ratio of 80%.\n3. Enter into a sale-and-leaseback, with the warehouse valued at $4.9 million and the first year’s rental payment of $150,000 payable at the start of the lease.\nBoshe has strong connections to the investment banking community. Richards has authorized her to ascertain the level of interest for the sale of MTL. Boshe is confident she can arrange any of the following strategies:\nMTL Strategy 1: A private equity firm can arrange to leverage MTL, paying Richards 40% of his estimated value of MTL (as shown in Exhibit 1), in cash up front and rolling the remaining 60% of the value into new shares that pay no dividends. Richards will stay on as president for five years, during which time he will help transition leadership to a new team. After five years, he will sell or monetize the remaining ownership.\nMTL Strategy 2: A small but rapidly growing publicly traded building materials company is willing to acquire 100% ownership and pay Richards $7 million in cash up front and employee stock options that he can exercise after two years and that expire in five years. The public company is too small to support publicly traded stock options. Should the public company’s stock rise, Richards can exercise his employee stock options, which will be taxed as ordinary income. To protect the value of his appreciated stock while participating in further upside potential, he can purchase long-term protective put options on an industry ETF that closely tracks the building materials industry. If the public company’s stock subsequently drops along with the industry, he can sell the puts.\nMTL Strategy 3: Create an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) that would borrow sufficient funds to purchase 40% of Richards’ ownership. Richards would maintain upside potential in his retained shares, which could be sold at some point in the future.",

        "context": "The Arbuckel family office was formed 10 years ago following the family’s sale of its minority ownership interest in a National Football League (NFL) franchise. The family office was created to formally manage the family’s investment affairs. The family’s investment portfolio has traditionally consisted of money market funds, corporate bonds, publicly traded US large-cap stocks, and equity small-cap mutual funds. Glen Arbuckel, the patriarch of the family, and his daughter, Jenna Arbuckel-Davis, co-manage the family office. They are considering adding alternative investments to the portfolio. They have hired Bill Clarke of Snyder Capital Management to provide independent investment counseling.\nClarke states that alternative investments typically include real estate, private equity, commodities, hedge funds, managed futures, and distressed securities. Arbuckel’s intention is to select private equity as the family’s first alternative investment because he believes that private equity is similar in nature to the ownership structure of NFL teams.\nClarke also states that alternative investments create some issues for private wealth investors that are distinct from those created by traditional investments. For example, consideration of decision risk will help the investor maintain his intended time horizon throughout the life of the alternative investment. Tax issues are not necessarily more complex because current income and capital appreciation are the primary sources of return for both alternative and traditional investments. Clarke notes that determining the suitability of an alternative investment is equally complex for both private wealth investors and institutional investors.\nArbuckle-Davis mentions an interest in venture capital and asks Clarke to discuss the venture capital timeline. Clarke illustrates the stage characteristics of a company as it evolves from a formative-stage company to an expansion-stage company. Arbuckel-Davis studies the various stage characteristics and decides that the best opportunities are investments that support the initial expansion of a company already producing and selling a product.\nTo invest in private equity, Clarke states that direct investment in an acquired company typically includes the purchase of common equity and convertible preferred stock. Other sources of capital for an acquired company include bank debt and senior notes. In terms of payment priority, in the event of an acquired company’s liquidation, bank debt and senior notes are normally senior to both convertible preferred stock and common equity, and convertible preferred stock is senior to common equity. When an acquired company is sold at a favorable price, bank debt, senior notes, and convertible preferred stock receive only promised payments whereas common equity earns very large returns.\nArbuckel suggests to his daughter that a private equity fund of funds may be more suitable than direct investment. He explains that the family would benefit from the ability of the fund manager to select worthy investments and maintain active involvement in those investments. Clarke notes that the compensation of a fund manager typically\nconsists of a flat management fee plus an incentive fee arrangement. He states that the incentive fee arrangement normally includes a profit-sharing component for the general partner, a hurdle rate for the limited partner, and a return of fees by the general partner to the limited partner based on the performance of the fund over the investment timeline . Clark illustrates by providing three examples of an incentive fee arrangement, as shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nClarke cautions that the strategy for a private equity investment should be formulated before any investment decision is made. The questions to consider with respect to the family’s investment policy statement include:\nQuestion 1: How will the choice of the exit strategy affect the return objective?\nQuestion 2: How will the limited secondary market affect the liquidity constraint?\nQuestion 3: How will the capital call commitment period affect the time horizon constraint?",

During a typical work week, he is called upon to evaluate a variety of situations and provide expert advice. This week, he is meeting with three clients.\nDodson's first client meeting is with the Magnolia Foundation, a small not-for-profit organization. Magnolia currently uses three long-only portfolio managers for its equity investments. Details of those investments, including expected performance relative to Magnolia's equity benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, are shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nMagnolia's goal for its total equity investment is expected alpha greater than 0.40% and expected tracking error less than 1.00%.\nDodson's second client meeting is with Sarah Tan, a wealthy individual who is actively involved in managing her investments. Tan wants to add a $100 million allocation to US midcap stocks, represented by the US S&P 400 Midcap Index, to her long-term asset allocation. No investment has been made to meet this new allocation.\nTan has not found any manager capable of generating positive alpha in US midcap stocks. She has, however, identified a long-only portfolio manager of Canadian equities whom she believes will produce positive alpha. This manager uses the S&P/TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) Index as a benchmark. Tan wants to create a portable alpha strategy that will earn the alpha of the Canadian equity portfolio and meet the new benchmark allocation to US midcap stocks. She asks Dodson for advice to establish this strategy. Tan provides some information about the security selection methods used by the Canadian equity portfolio manager. The Canadian manager uses a proprietary discounted cash flow model to analyze all stocks in the S&P/TSX Index and purchases those with market prices that are the most below the intrinsic value estimated by his model, regardless of their price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es).\nDodson's third client meeting is with the chief investment officer (CIO) of Susquehanna Industries' pension fund. The fund needs to establish a $50 million portfolio that replicates the Russell 2000 Index, an index of small-cap US equities. The CIO's goal is to minimize trading costs. He asks Dodson to suggest an investment approach that will meet this goal. The CIO also outlines his portfolio managers' sell discipline with respect to the pension fund's actively managed value and growth equity portfolios. Currently, the managers monitor the P/E of each stock held. A value stock is sold when its P/E rises to its 10-year historical average. A growth stock is sold when its P/E falls to its 10-year historical average.",

Delta Managers is the third and final presenter to Berg's investment committee. After going through its investment philosophy and process, Delta addresses several questions.\nAlpha expresses concern about the use of leverage in the portfolio. Delta indicates that by using 100% leverage, it can generate incremental returns. Delta provides the committee with the portfolio's characteristics in Exhibit 1.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\nBerg's committee is concerned that the portfolio's duration is inappropriate given the committee's view that rates might rise. They ask how Delta can use the futures market to manage the portfolio's interest rate risk. The committee states that it would like a target duration of 4.\n\n\nDelta then makes the following statement to the committee:\nInternational interest rates are not perfectly correlated. In fact, because this is a global bond portfolio, 60% of the portfolio is from German issuers and has average duration of 7 and the remainder is from UK issuers with average duration of 4.5, both before any hedging activities to meet the committee's duration target. Historically, the country beta of the United Kingdom (i.e., for German rates relative to UK rates) is estimated to be 0.55.\n\n\n<image_2>\n\nBerg's committee then asks Delta to make a recommendation about whether the portfolio should be hedged back to the euro, its domestic currency. Delta responds that short interest rates are currently 2.50% in the United Kingdom and 3.25% in Germany and that Delta's currency strategists forecast that the euro will depreciate by 0.35%.\nBerg's committee then asks whether a global portfolio would benefit from the inclusion of emerging market debt. Delta responds that returns can be attractive in emerging markets during certain periods but that the following risks of this asset class must be understood:\nRisk 1: Returns are frequently characterized by substantial positive skewness. Risk 2: If a default of sovereign debt occurs, recovery against sovereign states can be difficult. Risk 3: The frequency of default and ratings transition is significantly higher than it is in developed market corporate bonds with similar ratings.\nAt the conclusion of the presentation, Alpha and Berg's committee convene to discuss which of the three managers that presented should be selected for the €100 million mandate. Alpha advises Berg that the following considerations are important when evaluating fixed-income portfolio managers:\nCriterion 1: Style analysis will enable us to understand the active risks the manager has taken relative to the benchmark and which biases have consistently added to performance. Criterion 2: Decomposing the portfolio's historical returns will show whether the manager's skills will allow the manager to consistently outperform over time. Criterion 3: We could select two of the three managers that presented if our analysis shows that the correlation between their alphas is low.",

        "context": "Karin Larsson is a new employee in the risk management group at Baltic Investment Management, Inc. She is replacing Sten Reinfeldt, who has agreed to help her transition into her new role. Reinfeldt explains that risk governance refers to the process of setting risk management policies and standards for an organization, thus enabling firms to establish appropriate ranges for exposures and to emphasize individual risk factors within a centralized type of enterprise risk management.\nBaltic manages proprietary investment strategies, which creates risk exposures for the firm. Reinfeldt explains that these risks are both financial and nonfinancial in nature and proceeds to list several specific sources of risk:\nRisk 1: Model risk\nRisk 2: Liquidity risk\nRisk 3: Settlement risk\nBaltic uses value at risk (VaR) as a probability-based measure of loss potential for its fixed-income strategies. Reinfeldt states that the VaR for the fixed-income strategy is SEK10 million during any five-day period with a probability of 5%. Larsson asks Reinfeldt to estimate the fixed-income strategy's VaR at given levels of probability for specified periods.\nBaltic manages an equity strategy in addition to the fixed-income strategy. The trading desks for each strategy are granted risk budgets that consider the allocation of both capital and daily VaR. The correlation between the equity desk and the fixed-income desk is low. Exhibit 1 provides risk-budgeting data for both desks.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\nReinfeldt comments that the risk management group has adopted stress testing to complement VaR analysis given some of its limitations. He lists several of limitations of VaR for Larsson:\nLimitation 1: VaR inaccurately measures risk exposure because it overestimates the magnitude and frequency of the worst returns.\n\nLimitation 2: VaR incompletely measures risk exposure because it does not incorporate positive results into its risk profile.\nLimitation 3: VaR incorrectly measures risk exposure because there are limited calculation methods and they often yield similar outcomes.\nLarsson is concerned about credit exposure within the fixed-income strategy and asks Reinfeldt how Baltic manages this risk. Reinfeldt responds, \"We manage credit risk in a number of ways. First, we use credit derivatives in order to transfer credit risk. Second, we mark to market our credit derivatives in order to post collateral whenever a credit derivative's value is positive to Baltic and negative to the swap counterparty.\"",

NMSA provides investment advisory and asset allocation services to private and institutional clients. Bing is an expert in the use of derivatives to manage portfolios. She is assisted by two analysts, Rakesh Sharma and Hernando Torres.\nBing is performing a review of client portfolios. She has collected the stock and bond index futures information that is presented in Exhibit 1. Futures prices are shown after accounting for the multiplier. Bing also notes that risk-free bonds with one year to maturity yield 1.5%.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\nBing manages a portfolio invested in US small-cap stocks for the Wellington Academy Endowment. The portfolio has a current market value of $321 million. Bing and her team believe that small-cap stocks will perform well over the next three months. After consulting with the endowment's trustees, Bing decides to raise the portfolio's beta from 0.8 to 1.2 for the next three months. She has also been informed that the endowment has received a $15 million cash donation that is to be invested in small caps. Bing and her team decide to use futures to equitize the new cash inflow for a period of three months.\nAnother one of Bing's clients is KP McLane Incorporated (KPM Inc.), a US-based manufacturer of men's apparel. The current market value of KPM Inc.'s pension portfolio is $950 million, with a 65% allocation to US midcap stocks and a 35% allocation to US bonds. The stock allocation has a beta of 1.45, and the bond allocation has a modified duration of 5.3. Bing's research indicates that midcap stocks are likely to underperform in the near term. Accordingly, she decides to reduce the allocation to midcap stocks to 60% and increase the bond allocation to 40%.\nKPM Inc. exports a significant portion of its products to eurozone countries. KPM Inc. expects the dollar to rise against the euro and is concerned that this change could lead to a decline in sales in the eurozone. KPM Inc. asks Bing for advice on how to manage this risk exposure.\nBing asks Sharma, \"We adjusted the asset allocation of the KPM Inc. pension fund using futures. Could we have used swaps to carry out the change?\"\n\n\nSharma responds, \"Yes, we could have used a combination of a fixed-income swap on the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index and an equity swap on the S&P 400 MidCap Index, where the notional value is $47.5 million.\"\nTCMS, a medical college, is also a client of NMSA. TCMS currently has a two-year loan outstanding with a 5.5% fixed annual interest rate. Bing expects a decline in interest rates and advises TCMS to enter into a two-year interest rate swap in which TCMS would pay Libor + 0.5% and receive a 5.5% fixed rate. From TCMS's perspective, the duration of a two-year fixed rate loan is –1.5 years and the duration of a floating rate loan is –0.125. Bing asks Torres, \"Can you comment on the overall impact of the interest rate swap on TCMS?\"\nTorres responds, \"The net effect of entering the swap is to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the overall loan plus swap position relative to the loan by itself. If the swap is added, however, it will be harder for TCMS to predict cash flows, and from this perspective, the swap does not serve as a good hedge.\"",

        "context": "Katherine Ng, a Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) specialist, has been hired as a consultant to assist Rune Managers in becoming a GIPS-compliant firm. Rune is a global asset manager with several divisions around the world that invest in both stock and bond strategies. James Arnott, a performance specialist at Rune, is responsible for the project. In their first meeting, Ng and Arnott discuss the GIPS standards and the steps Rune will need to take to become compliant.\nNg recommends starting with the definition of the firm. She tells Arnott that how the firm is defined will affect the compliance process and that the standards recommend the firm be defined as broadly as possible. Arnott replies that Rune management has been discussing the firm definition, and they want the definition to include all Rune divisions except the European division, Rune Europe. Rune Europe has its own strategies and management team that are distinct from the rest of Rune. Ng replies that the Rune Europe division should be included in the definition of the firm because the division markets itself as part of Rune Managers.\nNg then asks about Rune's policies for the inclusion of portfolios in composites. Arnott responds that Rune has the following policies for all composites:\nPolicy 1: All new accounts funded with cash or securities on or before the 10th day of the month are added to the composite at the beginning of the following month. Those funded after the 10th day of the month are added at the beginning of the 2nd month after funding, or at the beginning of the calendar month after the proceeds are substantially invested in the appropriate strategy.\nPolicy 2: All portfolios are deemed \"non-discretionary\" on the date the notice of termination of the management relationship is received and removed from the composite at the end of the month of notification.\nThe discussion then moves on to a new composite that Rune is constructing. Arnott tells Ng that the marketing department has decided to target domestic Swiss investors and would like to carve out the Swiss portion of international and global accounts for the period of 1 January 2006 through 1 January 2011 and allocate cash to each carved-out segment to create a Swiss franc (CHF) composite. Ng responds that this new composite will comply with the standards, but Rune must disclose the percentage of composite assets that are carve-outs for each annual period end, as well as the policy used to allocate cash to the carved-out segments.\nArnott interjects that the marketing department is looking forward to claiming GIPs compliance in advertisements. He is meeting with the marketing department and asks Ng what they need to be aware of regarding the Standards in advertising. Ng responds that there are several requirements in the GIPS Advertising Guidelines; specifically, the following must be disclosed in the advertisements: the firm description, composite and benchmark descriptions, and the number of accounts in the composite.\n\nArnott and Ng then move on to discuss one of Rune's GIPS-compliant performance presentations, provided in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nRune Managers claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. Rune Managers has not been independently verified.\nNotes:\n1. Rune Managers is an investment manager registered with the US SEC. Rune Managers has divisions in Europe, Asia, and the United States that invest in various equity and bond strategies.\n2. The Rune Mid-Capitalization Equity Composite includes all institutional portfolios that invest in mid-capitalization US equities, with the goal of providing long-term capital growth and steady income from dividends by investing in low price-to-earnings, undervalued securities.\n3. A complete list and description of Rune Managers' composites, as well as policies for valuing portfolios and preparing compliant presentations, are available upon request.\n4. The composite was created on 30 November 2005.\n5. Leverage, derivatives, and short positions are not used by this strategy.\n6. Performance is expressed in US dollars. The returns include the reinvestment of all income. Gross-of-fees returns are presented before management and custodial fees but after all trading expenses. Net-of-fees returns are calculated by deducting the actual fees of the accounts from the gross composite return.\n7. The management fee schedule is as follows: 0.80% on the first $10 million, 0.55% on the next $40 million, 0.40% on assets greater than $50 million.\n8. This presentation is not required to conform to any laws or regulations that conflict with the GIPS standards.\n9. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of annual gross returns of those portfolios that were included in the composite for the entire year.\n10. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark returns during the preceding 36-month period. The standard deviation is not presented for 2006 through 2010 because monthly composite and benchmark returns were not available, and it is not required for periods prior to 2011.",

        "context": "Alexandra Sorenson has been made an investment strategist at Culpepper Investment Management (Culpepper) after working as a senior investment analyst the past several years. Sorenson has covered US equities throughout her career and has only limited knowledge of international capital markets. She is reviewing the economic and capital markets forecast report recently prepared by Culpepper’s economist as she evaluates the holdings in the firm’s investment portfolio.\nExhibit 1 compares growth projections based on the economist’s outlook for the United States and EuroCountryX.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nSorenson discusses the valuation of the EuroCountryX Stock Index with Stefan Dreschler, a fellow investment strategist. The Index comprises mature, large-cap common equities. Sorenson plans to use the Cobb–Douglas model, assuming constant returns to scale, to estimate the country’s GDP growth. Given the mature nature of the economy and the market index, growth in both inflation-adjusted earnings and dividends is expected to equal real GDP growth. The current year annual dividend of the EuroCountryX Stock Index is €133.\nSorenson assumes that a 6.0% discount rate is appropriate for the foreseeable future and calculates the fair value of the Index at 31 December.\nSorenson comments to Dreschler:\n“I see that at the end of December this year, the index was trading nearly 20% above its level a year ago. What do you think may have caused the price gain?”\nThe two continue discussing what changes Sorenson might face in her new position. She asks Dreschler:\n“What challenges do we face when using discounted dividend models and macroeconomic forecasts to estimate the intrinsic value of an equity market in a developing country?”\nDreschler responds by making several points:\n· Discount rates are relatively easy to estimate, whereas growth rates are difficult to estimate.\n· Corporate profit trends should be relatively consistent with the overall growth of the country’s GDP.\n· Gathering accurate and consistent economic data could be a challenge.\n\n\nAs an investment analyst, Sorenson is experienced with bottom-up analysis but realizes that top-down analysis will now be important. She asks Dreschler what they should consider when comparing the two approaches. Dreschler makes the following points:\n· Top-down analysis can be slower than bottom-up analysis in detecting cyclical turns.\n· Top-down estimates coming out of a recession may be less optimistic than bottom-up estimates.\n· We should expect to get the same results regardless of which method we use.\nSorenson is interested in learning how earnings-based and asset-based relative value models can be used to better manage the firm’s investment portfolio. She first asks Dreschler to compare the Yardeni and Fed models. Dreschler responds by making these points:\n· The Yardeni model assumes that the required rate of return on equity equals the T-bond yield.\n· Although the Yardeni model captures a greater portion of the risk premium than the Fed model, it still does not accurately measure equity risk.\n· Both the Yardeni model and the Fed model are consistent in the way they measure the earnings growth rate.\nSorenson decides to calculate Tobin’s q and determine the relative value of the market assuming an equilibrium level of approximately 1.0. Exhibit 2 provides partial information about the US economy that will be useful in her analysis.\n\n<image_2>",

He begins his presentation by stating that people often harbor misleading views about life insurance. As an example, he provides them with the following three comments which he claims to have heard many times in the past:\nComment 1 Since everyone is going to die, everyone needs life insurance.\nComment 2 Life insurance is an efficient method of risk reduction.\nComment 3 Premiums on a newly issued life insurance policy are higher when interest rates are lower.\nBoylan states that when considering life insurance needs and investment strategies, it is important to understand the notion of human capital. He provides the following four examples of individuals connected to the health care industry in Exhibit 1 and asks the audience which of them has the highest human capital risk.\n\n<image_1>\n<image_2>\n\nBoylan provides selected information from standard mortality tables along with some market data and characteristics of Marie’s medical specialty in Exhibit 2. In addition, he also includes several assumptions which he uses to determine Marie’s total assets under a holistic balance sheet.\n\n<image_3>\n\nOne of the attendees at the presentation told Boylan that she had accessed several life insurance carrier websites but found that it was very hard to compare the costs of their whole life policy offerings, as the companies often used different assumptions\nAMabout the amount of the death benefit, premiums, cash value growth rates and divi-dend reinvestment rates. Using the information in Exhibit 3 for a hypothetical whole life policy, Boylan illustrates a convenient method for comparing the cost of different policies when these variables change.\n\n<image_4>\n\nBoylan turns his attention to investments. He tells his audience that if the twins, Janice and Jason, wish to invest optimally, they should consider the nature of their human capital when making asset allocation decisions. He asks how this would affect their relative allocation to high grade government bonds.\nBoylan tells the audience that life annuities are a convenient investment to deal with longevity risk. He again uses the twins, Jason and Janice, as an example, in discussing some of the characteristics of these annuities. Assuming that they were both to invest the same amount into this product, he makes the following statements:\nStatement 1 If both of them were to purchase the annuity immediately, they would both receive the same annual income yield.\nStatement 2 If Jason were to purchase the annuity in 10 years rather than immediately, his annual income yield would be higher at that time than now.\nStatement 3 If Janice were to add a 10-year period certain option to her annuity, her income yield would be reduced when compared to not having the option, but it would be reduced by greater amounts the longer she waits to purchase the annuity.",

        "context": "Karina Mamani is a senior partner at Trujillo Partners, an investment advisory firm headquartered in Lima, Peru. Mamani specializes in domestic (Peruvian) markets. Peru's currency is the nuevo sol (PEN). Its major stock exchange is the Bolsa de Valores de Lima (BVL), and the primary index for that market is the Indice General Bolsa de Valores (IGBVL).\nOne of Mamani's clients, Angel Huanca, anticipates receipt of PEN10,000,000 from debt investments that are maturing in two months. He will invest these proceeds in an IGBVL index fund. Huanca expects the Peruvian stock market to increase dramatically in the next two months and does not want to miss out on the expected gain. He asks Mamani to recommend a way to obtain exposure to the IGBVL immediately. Mamani recommends a long futures position using a two-month futures contract on the IGBVL that is priced at PEN21,800 and has a contract size of PEN10 times the price. The index has a beta of 0.98, and the futures contract has a beta of 1.05.\nHuanca owns a company that produces auto parts, primarily for export to the United States. He tells Mamani he is worried the nuevo sol will strengthen relative to the US dollar and other currencies, making it more difficult for him to compete with firms in the United States and elsewhere. He asks Mamani to help him devise long-term strategies to deal with this risk.\nHuanca recently received 3.2 million common stock shares of Urubamba Copper, Ltd. in partial payment for a mining equipment company he sold to Urubamba. The terms of the sale require him to hold this stock for at least 18 months before selling it. Although Huanca believes Urubamba is a well-run company, its share price is closely tied to commodity prices, which he believes might decline. He tells Mamani, \"I know I can use options on Urubamba to manage the risk of my concentrated stock position. Either a covered call strategy or a protective put strategy will reduce the volatility of my position and establish a minimum value for it, but the covered call strategy will also enhance my return if Urubamba's price remains stable, and the protective put strategy will not.\"\nAnother of Mamani's clients, Arequipa Industries (AI), is about to borrow PEN120 million for two years at a floating rate of 180-day Libor (currently 3.25%) plus a fixed spread of 90 basis points with semiannual resets, interest payments based on actual days/360, and repayment of principal at maturity. AI's management is worried that Libor might rise during the term of the loan and asks Mamani to recommend strategies to reduce this risk. Mamani suggests a zero-cost collar on 180-day Libor with a cap of 4.70% and a floor of 2.25%, payment dates matching the loan payments (on 30 June and 31 December, with the first payment on 31 December), and interest based on actual days/360. She develops various examples of the collar's impact, including one using the interest rate scenario in Exhibit 1.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nMamani informs AI's management that, as an alternative, it could enter into an interest rate swap to effectively convert its floating-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan. Mamani states, \"You would take a position in a two-year swap with semiannual payments and a notional principal equal to your loan balance. You would pay a fixed rate equal to current two-year Libor and receive 180-day Libor.\" Mamani adds, \"Entering into the swap would reduce your firm's market value risk and cash flow risk.\"",

        "context": "The Kohler Family Foundation, an entity not subject to taxes, partially supports the financing of annual operating expenses for Kohler College . In addition to these annual costs, the Foundation has just committed itself to partially fund five different campus building renovation projects over the next 15 years, including student housing renovations in three dormitories and the expansion of classroom wings in two academic buildings.\nBecause of these new financial commitments, the Foundation’s investment committee, chaired by Frederick Schumacher, has decided to engage ECU Investment Management for advice on changing the Foundation’s portfolio asset allocation.\nThomas Roth, a senior investment consultant at ECU, conducts an introductory meeting with Schumacher to examine the Foundation’s asset allocation.\nSchumacher explains to Roth:\n“Our investment committee has discussed the necessity for changes to our approach to strategic asset allocation. We believe that these three standards should drive the Foundation’s strategic asset allocation and we want your opinion of them:\nStandard 1: Our allocation should include long-term exposures to the systematic risks of the various asset classes.\nStandard 2: Asset class weights should satisfy our investment objectives and constraints.\nStandard 3: Perceived disequilibriums in markets in a given period should affect our asset weightings in the subsequent period.”\nRoth states: “Your future building renovation projects indicate that an asset/liability management (ALM) approach to the Foundation’s strategic asset allocation would be appropriate . ALM seeks to adopt the optimal asset allocation in relationship to funding financial obligations.”\nSchumacher replies:\n“That seems to be an intelligent suggestion. I imagine the following three outcomes would result from adopting that approach:\nOutcome 1: We would have a higher allocation to fixed income.\nOutcome 2: The global market equilibrium portfolio would be our default asset allocation to which we would make adjustments to meet our future liabilities.\nOutcome 3: Portfolio risk control related to our future spending needs would likely not be very precise.”\nRoth inquires: “Can you explain how the Foundation has approached asset allocation in the past ? I would also like to understand your asset class specification methods.”\n\nSchumacher explains: “Historically, our portfolio has comprised a diversified collection of domestic large-cap equities. We now believe we should diversify into additional asset classes, such as domestic mid-cap and small-cap equities. I have listed the asset classes we are considering in Exhibit 1 for your review.”\n\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nSchumacher observes: “Asset classes 4, 5, and 6 all have low correlations with equities . For diversification purposes, does it really make a difference which one we add?”\nRoth comments: “We believe the addition of asset classes to your existing equity portfolio should be done with the goal of achieving a mean–variance improvement when including the new asset class. The Foundation should invest a major portion of the portfolio internationally, diversified across asset classes. As an example, our ECU Global Tactical Allocation Fund invests in non–US dollar (USD) equities, fixed income, and real estate, as well as in real return assets, such as commodities. The primary inputs to our tactical asset allocation decisions are a long-term outlook for the next three to five years and a six-month short-term forecast for each asset class. The weighted foreign currency exposure of our equities and fixed income mirrors the US Dollar Index, and we value our real estate and real return assets in USD. Exhibit 2 shows our fund’s strategic asset allocation weightings plus investment return and currency forecasts.”\n\n<image_2>\n\n\nNote: Short-term US Dollar Index forecast versus weighted currencies in portfolio: +3%.\nSchumacher says: “I have the following three concerns with respect to investing internationally:\nConcern 1: In times of market stress, diversification benefits can be drastically reduced.\nConcern 2: Capital in some countries does not flow freely across borders, which can result in increased market segmentation.\nConcern 3: Traditional mean–variance analysis may not apply.”\nRoth replies: “Your concerns pertain to conditional correlation, market integration, and the efficient frontier; however, they are not all necessarily disadvantages.”",

        "context": "Asis Subramanium was recently hired by the pension fund Nash, Barwich, and Stuart (NBS) as a Portfolio Performance Evaluation Specialist. NBS does not have a formal performance evaluation policy and Dev Radia, Director of Portfolio Management, asks Subramanium to develop such a policy for the firm.\nCollecting research related to performance evaluation, Subramanium tells Radia that a performance evaluation policy should address the following three major issues:\n1. Performance measurement defined as the calculation of the rates of return based on investment-related changes in an account’s value over specified time periods;\n2. Performance attribution which investigates the sources of the account’s performance relative to a manager’s past performance and the importance of those sources; and\n3. Performance appraisal which attempts to answer the question whether the account’s performance is due to luck or skill.\nThe two start their discussion of other issues relating to performance evaluation by comparing time-weighted return (TWR) to money-weighted return (MWR). Subramanium provides an example of the two methods using the recent month’s history of the West Riverdale Defined Benefit Plan. As indicated in Exhibit 1, the start of month value of the plan was $20,000,000. The portfolio is revalued whenever a cash flow arises and all daily cash flows occur at the end of the stated day, e.g., on the eight day into the month the account received a contribution of $200,000 and had an end of the day value of $21,200,000. At the end of the month (day 30), the terminal value of the account was $20,255,000.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nRadia picks up the discussion at this point, saying, “Having calculated TWR and/or MWR, one needs a benchmark against which the account return can be compared. Many issues arise in this choice of a benchmark.” Radia points out three:\n\n1. Consultants and fund sponsors frequently use the median manager or fund from a broad universe of managers or funds as a performance evaluation benchmark. This approach is flawed, as it fails the test of being measurable.\n2. A drawback of a style index is that the definition of investment style implied in the benchmark may be inconsistent with the investment process of the manager.\n3. The absolute return objective is generally the preferred approach.\nThe two move on to consider performance evaluation of hedge funds and agree that hedge fund performance can be especially difficult to evaluate. They provide three reasons why this is so:\n1. If the hedge fund consists of a long-short portfolio which nets to an initial market value of zero, the rate of return on the portfolio would be undefined, approaching either positive infinity or negative infinity due to this division by zero problem.\n2. Even when the hedge fund’s assets do not net to zero, the vagueness of defining “hedge funds” makes it difficult to assign specific benchmarks.\n3. The option-like features of many hedge funds make the use of the Sharpe ratio a preferred approach to performance measurement.\nThe two agree that investment skill requires a manager to outperform an appropriate benchmark, on average over time, and on a risk-adjusted basis. Commonly used measures that adjust for risk are the Treynor measure, the Sharpe ratio, and M2. To demonstrate the differences between these three measures, Subramanium collects the data given in Exhibit 2 along with his partially completed calculations on three accounts.\n\n<image_2>\n\nFinally, Radia asks Subramanium if there are any issues to be considered regarding manager continuation policy. Subramanium answers that there are two types of mistakes you can make:\n· one mistake is to fire (or not hire) a manager with positive value-added management;\n· a second mistake is to keep (or hire) managers that provide zero value-added.",

To complete her analysis, she has obtained the market data in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nAllison’s assistant has prepared the following summaries of each client’s current situation, including any recent inquiries or requests from the client.\n· Client A has a $20 million technology equity portfolio. At the beginning of the previous quarter, Allison forecasted a weak equity market and recommended adjusting the risk of the portfolio by reducing the portfolio’s beta from 1.20 to 1.05. To reduce the beta, Allison sold NASDAQ 100 futures contracts at $124,450 on 25 December. During the quarter, the market decreased by 3.5%, the value of the equity portfolio decreased by 5.1%, and the NASDAQ futures contract price fell from $124,450 to $119,347. Client A has questioned the effectiveness of the futures transaction used to adjust the portfolio beta.\n· Client B’s portfolio holds $40 million of U.S. large-cap value stocks with a portfolio beta of 1.06. This client wants to shift $22 million from value to growth stocks with a target beta of 1.21. Allison will implement this shift using S&P/Barra Growth and S&P/Barra Value futures contracts.\n· Client C anticipates receiving $75 million in December. This client is optimistic about the near-term performance of the equity and debt markets and does not want to wait until the money is received to invest it. The client wants Allison to establish a position that allocates 60% of the money to a well-diversified equity portfolio with a target beta of 1.00 and 40% of the money to a long-term debt portfolio with a target modified duration of 5.75. Allison plans to use the December U.S. Treasury-bond futures to establish the debt position.\n· Client D’s $100 million portfolio contains $60 million in U.S. large-cap stocks, $20 million in U.S. Treasury bills, and $20 million in U.S. Treasury bonds. The client wants to create a synthetic cash position because he believes that in three months, the level of the S&P 500 Index will be 925.00, and Treasury bond yields will have declined.\n· Client E’s $60 million portfolio contains $40 million in large-cap growth stocks and $20 million in U.S. Treasury bonds. The beta of the stock portfolio is 1.25 and the duration of the bond portfolio is 5.0. The client believes that macro economic conditions over the next three months are such that the level of the S&P/Barra Growth Index will be 400.00 and the price of the U.S. Treasury bond futures contract will be $110,400.\n· Client F has $10 million in cash and is optimistic about the near-term performance of U.S. large-cap stocks and U.S. Treasury bonds. The client anticipates positive performance for approximately three months. Client F asks Allison to implement a strategy that will create profit from this view if it proves to be correct.",

        "context": "Pascal Montero is the director of the treasury department of the Viewmont Corporation, which is based in Chicago, Illinois. Viewmont manufactures steel and aluminum food cans in plants located in the United States and Brazil. Generally, raw materials are sourced from suppliers located in the country where the plant is located. But when shortages occur at a particular location, Viewmont imports raw materials.\nMontero’s duties include procuring financing and managing interest rate and currency risk for Viewmont. Montero is meeting with two of his senior analysts, Maissa Bazlamit and Jacky Kemigisa, to plan the company’s hedging and financing activities.\nBazlamit informs Montero that because of domestic shortages, Viewmont will need to import aluminum from Brazil for its U.S. plant. Payment for the aluminum will be in Brazilian reals (BRL) and is due on delivery three months from now. Bazlamit states, “To manage our translation exposure from unfavorable exchange rate movements, we should enter into a long forward contract on Brazilian reals.”\nKemigisa has determined that in 60 days, Viewmont will also need to raise USD50,000,000 for domestic operations. To protect against a rise in interest rates over this period, Kemigisa is evaluating the purchase of a USD50,000,000 interest rate call option. Interest and principal on the loan is due upon its maturity. Details of the loan and the interest rate call are provided in Exhibit 1.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\nBazlamit suggests using an interest rate swap instead of interest rate call options. She states, “By entering into an interest rate swap in which we receive a floating rate in return for paying a fixed rate of interest, we can hedge against rising interest rates and thus stabilize Viewmont’s cash outflows. The swap will also reduce the sensitivity of Viewmont’s overall position to changes in interest rates.”\n\n\nMontero responds, “I think a better alternative to the interest rate swap you suggest is an interest rate swaption. For example, we could purchase a payer swaption with an exercise rate of 3% that allows us to receive a rate of LIBOR. If fixed rates rise above 3% in 60 days, then excluding the effect of the swaption premium, our net interest payment will be equal to 3%.”\nViewmont is planning an expansion of its manufacturing capacity in Brazil. At the current exchange rate, BRL1.72/USD1, the expansion will cost BRL86,000,000, or USD50,000,000. Montero and his team discuss alternative ways to raise the capital required so that Viewmont can achieve the lowest borrowing cost and hedge against exchange rate risk. Bazlamit suggests Viewmont can achieve the lowest borrowing cost and avoid currency risk by borrowing directly in Brazilian reals. Kemigisa disagrees and suggests that Viewmont, being based in the United States, receives the best terms by borrowing domestically and then converting the proceeds to Brazilian reals at current exchange rates. Montero states, “Viewmont will enjoy the lowest borrowing cost by borrowing in U.S. dollars and then engaging in a currency swap to obtain Brazilian reals.” Earnings from the Brazilian operation are repatriated to the United States each quarter. Montero and his team estimate that over the next year, quarterly cash flows from the Brazilian unit will be BRL5,000,000. Montero asks his team to evaluate the use of a currency swap to manage the currency risk of the earnings repatriation. The swap will involve fixed interest for fixed payments and the annual fixed interest rate for payments in Brazilian reals is 5% and 3% for U.S. dollars.",

Chesapeake advises a diverse client base on a variety of investment matters including asset allocation and manager selection. Each month the committee meets to discuss client inquiries and assignments the consultants are working on. Norfolk convenes the committee to discuss pressing issues for several clients.\nNorfolk asks William Burg, a field consultant, to present on a new client, a small college that Chesapeake advises with regard to the pension fund and the endowment. Burg needs to recommend to the client an appropriate benchmark for each fund. Burg tells the committee, \"I recommend that the pension fund benchmark be changed from the pension's liabilities as the benchmark to a bond market index. The pension is closed to new participants and thus the amount and timing of future cash flows are known. The endowment is invested across many asset classes and generate an adequate return to meet its obligations, which consists of a 5% annual contribution to the college's operating fund. The endowment's benchmark for fixed-income managers should continue to be a bond market index, such as Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.\"\nAlex Manassas, a committee member asks Burg, \"What factors do you consider in selecting a benchmark bond index?\" Burg responds, \"I look at three key factors when selecting a benchmark. Market value risk should be similar for the portfolio and the benchmark. The longer the duration, the greater the total return potential because rates are low now and the yield curve is so steep. Income risk is important for comparable assured income streams, which can be more stable and dependable in a portfolio with long maturities. The average credit risk in the benchmark should be measured against the investor's overall portfolio and satisfy credit quality constraints in the policy statement.\"\nBoris Markov is the firm's actuary and expert on asset liability management. His client is a life insurance company that sells guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). The company hired Chesapeake because it has not met the target yield of 4% on the GICs it sold. Markov proposes a new approach to satisfy the obligation: \"First, the new single-period immunization strategy should require as a minimum condition that the duration of the bond portfolio equal the investment horizon. In addition, if the bond portfolio has a yield to maturity equal to the target yield and a maturity equal to the investment horizon, then the target value will be achieved\".\nMarkov then discusses another client that will require a rebalancing of its portfolio after a shift in interest rates over the last year to maintain the initial dollar duration. He uses the data in the table below to explain to the committee his rebalancing methodology.\n\n<image_1>\n\nJuan Ramirez, Chesapeake's chief investment officer, brings forward to the committee two investment issues that he would like to discuss. Ramirez tells the committee, \"Some of our client's portfolios are for the purpose of funding liabilities, and I am concerned that these liabilities will not be met, given certain risks. In particular, I have noticed that client portfolios have a substantial position in mortgaged-backed securities. We should reallocate these securities to invest in corporate bonds so the portfolio's convexity matches that of the liabilities.\"\nRamirez then presents the committee with the second investment issue. He is focused on a presentation that Alpha Managers, an investment firm that hopes to make it onto Chesapeake's \"buy list,\" made recently. He tells the committee, \"I am perplexed by the bottom-up capability that Alpha claims to have in adding value to portfolios. They claim to have a bias to yield maximization across securities without regard to rating differentials.\"",

EFC provides a range of consulting services including advice on investment strategy and selection of money managers. Currently, Sarkar is working with three clients: (1) Hayes University Endowment, (2) Bayside Foundation, and (3) Daniels Corporation Pension Plan. Hayes University Endowment The Hayes University Endowment is willing to accept a certain degree of tracking risk, provided that it is compensated with incremental returns. In particular, Hayes wants to implement an investment approach that maximizes the information ratio. Sarkar indicates that there are two alternate methods to implement the investment approach favored by Hayes: Method 1 Under this method, cash in the portfolio is equitized by using a long futures position. The cash is invested in short- to medium-term fixed-income securities. Method 2 The manager will only invest in stocks expected to outperform the index. If the manager has no opinion on a stock, or if the stock is expected to underperform, the stock will not be included in the investment portfolio. Bayside Foundation The investment policy committee for Bayside Foundation follows a fairly conservative investment strategy and pays particular attention to the minimization of tracking error. Bayside seeks to achieve two specific objectives. Objective 1 Invest a portion of the portfolio in an index with a large-cap bias. In addition to minimizing tracking error, Bayside would also like to ensure that the index strategy involves minimal rebalancing costs. Objective 2 Allocate another portion of the portfolio so it earns alpha associated with small-cap stocks but without the associated small-cap market beta exposure. Daniels Corporation Pension Plan Daniels Corporation pension trustees want to allocate a portion of the equity pension portfolio to an active money manager with a value investment style.

Simko asks her investment adviser, Mike Spong, to recommend a new fixed-income manager. Spong selects three fixed-income portfolio managers for Simko to consider:\n- Mondavi Investment Partners\n- Smithers Associates\n- Vertex Group\nSelected characteristics for each manager’s portfolio are provided in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nNote that in Exhibit 1, the portfolio duration for the benchmark, Mondavi Investment Partners, and Smithers Associates portfolios is 4.7. Portfolio duration for Vertex Group is 4.3.\nSpong makes the following statements to Simko regarding Exhibit 1:\n1. Mondavi follows a full-replication approach in which portfolio performance will match the fixed-income benchmark’s performance. Mondavi’s portfolio sector weights, duration, convexity, and term structure match those of the benchmark. Smithers’s portfolio characteristics do not match the benchmark’s because Smithers has minor risk factor mismatches with the benchmark.\n2. Vertex’s strategy is to construct a portfolio that has significant mismatches with the benchmark with respect to duration, key rate duration, and sector allocations. Vertex also relies on proprietary interest rate forecast models to generate superior portfolio returns. Vertex’s objectives are to ensure that tracking risk is minimized and portfolio return exceeds benchmark return.\n3. Vertex evaluates potential trades using total return analysis. Total return analysis assesses the expected effect of a trade on total portfolio return based on an interest rate forecast. For example, Vertex recently evaluated the expected total return for a single bond, with a beginning price of $103, a 5% semiannual coupon, an expected price at the end of one year of $102.5, and an annual reinvestment rate of 2%.\n4. Vertex also positions the portfolio to reflect the firm’s opinions on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads. Over the next six months, Vertex is forecasting\n· low and stable implied interest rate volatility,\n· spreads to narrow across all spread sectors by 25 bps, and\n· a positively sloped yield curve with short rates rising 50 bps and long rates rising by about 75 bps.",

Spong's fourth statement indicates that Vertex expects a 25 bp rise in short-term rates and a 75 bp increase in long-term rates—that is, the yield curve is expected to steepen. In this environment callables and putables will outperform bullet structures. As rates rise, given low implied interest rate volatility, the probability of a call diminishes as does the value of the call option. Consequently, callables will outperform bullets. As rates rise the put option becomes more valuable, furthermore the put allows the investor to put the option back at par, thus avoiding losses. For these reasons, the value of the putable structure can be expected to increase. In contrast, the bullet structure will decline in value. Thus, putables also outperform bullets.",

The fund’s investment policy statement sets forth allocation ranges for major asset classes, including U.S. large, mid-, and small-cap stocks, international equities, and domestic and international bonds.\nWhen revising its outlook for the capital markets, CME typically applies data from GloboStats Research on the global investable market (GIM) and major asset classes to produce long-term estimates for risk premiums, expected return, and risk measurements. Although they have worked with GloboStats for many years, CME is evaluating the services of RiteVal, a competing research firm, via a trial offer. Unlike the equilibrium modeling approach applied to GloboStats’s data, RiteVal prefers to use a multifactor modeling approach. Both research firms also provide short- and long-term economic analysis.\nCME has asked Pauline Cortez, chief investment officer, to analyze the benefit of adding U.S. real estate equities as a permanent asset class. To determine the appropriate risk premium and expected return for this new asset class, Cortez needs to determine the appropriate risk factor to apply to the international capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). Selected data from GloboStats is shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nCortez’s colleague Jason Grey notes that U.S. real estate is a partially segmented market. For this reason, Grey recommends using the Singer–Terhaar approach to the ICAPM and assumes a correlation of 0.39 between U.S. real estate and the GIM.\nCortez reviews RiteVal data (Exhibit 2) and preferred two-factor model with global equity and global bonds as the two common drivers of return for all other asset classes.\n<image_2>\n\nGrey makes the following observations about the two different approaches the research firms use to create their respective covariance matrices:\n• GloboStats uses a historical sample to estimate covariances, whereas\n• RiteVal uses a target covariance matrix by relating asset class returns to a particular set of return drivers.\nGrey recommends choosing the GloboStats approach.\nCortez states: I disagree. We will use the results of both firms by calculating a weighted average for each covariance estimate.\nGrey finds that RiteVal’s economic commentary reveals a non-consensus view on inflation. Specifically, they believe that a near-term period of deflation will surprise many investors but that the current central bank policy will eventually result in a return to an equilibrium expected level of inflation.\nGrey states: If RiteVal is correct, in the near-term our income producing assets, such as Treasury bonds and real estate, should do well because of the unexpected improvement in purchasing power. When inflation returns to the expected level, our equities are likely to perform well.\nCortez points out that RiteVal uses an econometrics approach to economic analysis, whereas GloboStats prefers a leading indicator–based approach. Cortez and Grey discuss these approaches at length.\nCortez comments: The big disadvantage to the leading indicator approach is that it has not historically worked because relationships between inputs are not static. One major advantage to the econometric approach is quantitative estimates of the effects on the economy of changes in exogenous variables.”",

        "context": "Arcadia, LLP, is one of several independently operated investment management subsidiaries of Swiss Corp, a global bank. Arcadia is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and specializes in the management of equity, fixed income and real estate portfolios. Arcadia’s CEO recently hired Joan Westley as chief compliance officer to achieve compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). Arcadia just opened a division in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated as Arcadia West, LLP, to accommodate one of its portfolio managers and his staff who manage a hedge fund. The staff in Phoenix works exclusively on the hedge fund’s strategy, using an investment process distinct from the one used in the Philadelphia office.\nWestley makes the following statement at a meeting with the CEO: “I am establishing and implementing policies and procedures to ensure Arcadia is in compliance with the GIPS standards. Although the hedge fund won’t be in compliance, it won’t affect our ability to be compliant firm-wide, because it is in an autonomous unit. We will be the first Swiss Corp subsidiary to be compliant. Keep in mind that even after implementation, we will not be able to claim compliance until our performance measurement policies, processes, and procedures are verified by an independent firm.”\nWestley begins her review of Arcadia’s current policies. She first reviews three policies regarding input data:\nPolicy 1: The accounting systems record the cost and book values of all assets. Portfolio valuations are based on market values, provided by a third-party pricing service.\nPolicy 2: Transactions are reflected in the portfolio when the exchange of cash, securities, and paperwork involved in a transaction is completed.\nPolicy 3: Accrual accounting is used for fixed-income securities and all other assets that accrue interest income; dividend-paying equities accrue dividends on the ex-dividend date.\nNext, Westley reviews Arcadia’s policies for return calculation methodologies:\nPolicy 4: Arcadia uses the Modified Dietz method to compute portfolio time-weighted rates of return on a monthly basis. Returns for longer measurement periods are computed by geometrically linking the monthly returns.\nPolicy 5: Arcadia revalues portfolios when capital equal to 10% or more of current market value is contributed or withdrawn. Returns are calculated after the deduction of trading expenses.\nPolicy 6: Cash and cash equivalents are excluded in total return calculations. Custody fees are not considered direct transaction costs.\nWestley also looks at the investment policy statements (IPS) for the three sample portfolios that are included in Arcadia’s large-capitalization equity composite:\n\nPortfolio A: A portfolio managed for a local church in which all fees are waived. The IPS prohibits holdings of companies involved in firearms, alcohol, or tobacco. These securities represent 5% of the benchmark, but the portfolio manager believes he can still implement his strategy with these restrictions.\nPortfolio B: The equity carve-out portfolio of a balanced account. The client provides Arcadia discretion in the tactical asset allocation decision. Asset allocation among subportfolios is performed quarterly and each subportfolio holds tactical or frictional cash.\nPortfolio C: A large-cap equity mutual fund managed for a corporate retirement plan. Employees can make contributions and withdrawals daily. The client requires the portfolio manager to maintain at least 15% of assets in cash balances to meet potential withdrawals.\nFinally, Westley examines a recent presentation to a prospective client regarding Arcadia’s small-cap composite. Details of this presentation are presented in Exhibit 1 and its notes.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nNotes: 1. Arcadia is an investment firm affiliated with a major global bank and founded in April 2001. The firm manages portfolios in various equity, fixed-income, and real estate strategies. 2. Arcadia has a number of affiliates owned by the parent company; a schedule is provided separately. 3. The composite has an inception date of 31 December 2007. A complete list and description of firm composites is available on request. 4. The composite includes all fee-paying, discretionary, nontaxable portfolios that follow a small-cap strategy. The composite does not include any non-fee-paying portfolios. 5. 1Q13 data are not annualized. 6. Valuations are computed and performance reported in U.S. dollars. 7. Internal dispersion is calculated by using the equal-weighted standard deviation of all portfolios that are included in the composite for the entire year. 8. Gross-of-fees performance returns are presented before management and custodial fees but after all trading expenses. The management fee schedule is as follows: 1.00% on first US$25 million; 0.60% thereafter. Net-of-fees performance returns are calculated by deducting the management fee of 0.25% from the quarterly gross composite return.",

Tom Fiske, the foundation’s chief investment officer, and his staff of three analysts use a top-down process that begins with an economic forecast, assignment of asset class weights, and selection of appropriate index funds.

Tom Fiske, the foundation’s chief investment officer, and his staff of three analysts use a top-down process that begins with an economic forecast, assignment of asset class weights, and selection of appropriate index funds. The team meets once a week to discuss a variety of topics ranging from economic modeling, economic outlook, portfolio performance, and investment opportunities, including those in emerging markets.\nAt the start of the meeting, Fiske asks the analysts, Len Tuoc, Kim Spenser, and Pier Poulsen, to describe and justify their different approaches to economic forecasting. They reply as follows.\nTuoc: I prefer econometric modeling. Robust models built with detailed regression analysis can help predict recessions well because the established relationships among the variables seldom change.\nSpenser: I like the economic indicators approach. For example, the composite of leading economic indicators is based on an analysis of its forecasting usefulness in past cycles. They are intuitive, simple to construct, require only a limited number of variables, and third-party versions are also available.\nPoulsen: The checklist approach is my choice. This straightforward approach considers the widest range of data. Using simple statistical method, such as time-series analysis, an analyst can quickly assess which measures are extreme. This approach relies less on subjectivity and is less time-consuming.”\nThe team then discusses what the long-term growth path for US GDP should be in the aftermath of exogenous shocks because of the financial crisis that began in 2008. They examine several reports from outside sources and develop a forecast for aggregate trend growth using the simple labor-based approach and appropriate data chosen from the items in Exhibit 1.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\nUpon a review of the portfolio and his discussion with the investment team, Fiske determines a need to increase US large-cap equities. He prefers to forecast the average annual return for US large-cap equities over the next 10 years using the Grinold–Kroner model and the data in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe analysts think that adding to US Treasuries would fit portfolio objectives, but they are concerned that the US Federal Reserve Board is likely to raise the fed funds rate soon. They assemble the data in Exhibit 3 in order to use the Taylor rule (giving equal weights to inflation and output gaps) to help predict the Fed’s next move with respect to interest rates.\n\n<image_3>\nTo assess the attractiveness of emerging market equities, Fiske suggests that they use the data in Exhibit 4 and determine the expected return of small-cap emerging market equities using the Singer–Terhaar approach.\n\n<image_4>\nFinally, after examining data pertaining to the European equity markets, the investment team believes that there are attractive investment opportunities in selected countries. Specifically, they compare the recent economic data with long-term average trends in three different countries, shown in Exhibit 5.\n\n<image_5>",

        "context": "Andres Rioja is the treasurer of Empresas Crianza. His duties have recently been expanded to include oversight of the firm’s pension fund. Given his limited experience in overseeing investments, he is relying on an outside consultant. Rioja prepares a number of questions for his first meeting with the consultant, Manolo Priorat of Consulta Jerez. Priorat starts the meeting by summarizing for Rioja the status of the defined benefit pension plan and makes the following statement: The pension liability has a duration of 14 years and a present value of $4 billion. The liabilities are discounted using the spot rate on high-quality long-term corporate bonds. Presently, the asset portfolio covers 87.5% of these liabilities and is invested entirely in fixed-income assets. The plan assets have fallen short of the pension liabilities over the past five years because their durations are not properly matched. I am concerned that Crianza has selected the wrong benchmark for the pension plan. The current benchmark is a weighted average of the benchmarks for the various strategies used in the investment of pension assets. I believe the appropriate benchmark should be the liability itself. Priorat and Rioja review the fixed-income funds in which the pension assets are currently invested. Portfolio managers have been given the mandate to meet or exceed their respective benchmarks based on their investment styles. Details of the various portfolios are provided in Exhibit 1.\n\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nRioja updates Priorat on Crianza’s current plans for the pension plan. Rioja states: “Crianza will make a $500 million contribution to fully fund the plan and invest the funds in Treasury STRIPs. In addition, we would like to completely reallocate pension investments away from the fund that presents the greatest contingent claim risk and into the long corporate bond fund.”\n\nRioja then asks Priorat, “I would like to understand the risk profile of each index benchmark we have assigned to the portfolio managers. What measures are available to do this?” Priorat responds,\nThere are several key measures that come to mind. Effective duration measures the sensitivity of the index’s price to a relatively small parallel shift in interest rates. For large non-parallel changes in interest rates, a convexity adjustment is used to improve the accuracy of the index’s estimated price change. Key rate duration measures the effect of shifts in key points along the yield curve. Key rate durations are particularly useful for determining the relative attractiveness of various portfolio strategies, such as bullet strategies versus barbell strategies. Spread duration describes how a non-Treasury security’s price will change as a result of the widening or narrowing of the spread contribution.\nRioja then asks about the rationale for active managers to do secondary market trades. Priorat responds,\nSecondary market trades should be evaluated in a total return framework. The exception is the yield or spread pickup trade, which should be evaluated in the context of additional yield. Credit-upside trades provide an opportunity for managers to capitalize on unexpected upgrades. Curve-adjustment trades are yet another example of investors expressing their interest rate views in the credit markets in anticipation of interest rate changes. Finally, Priorat offers further explanation of how active managers can add value. He notes,\nStructural analysis of corporate bonds is an important part of active management. Credit bullets in conjunction with long-end Treasury structures are used in a barbell strategy. Callable bonds provide a spread premium that can be valuable to an investor during periods of high interest rate volatility. Put structures will provide investors with some protection in the event that interest rates rise sharply but not if the issuer has an unexpected credit event.”",

In preparation, Gatchell meets with Anjou Lafite, another analyst at the fund, to review a relevant part of the endowment’s investment policy statement: Funds will be invested in the most efficient vehicle that meets the investment objective. Each manager must demonstrate the efficiency with which the tracking error they use delivers active return. In addition, each manager must consistently adhere to his or her stated style. Gatchell is given the task of reviewing three investment managers and selecting a manager that is most likely to adhere to Sonera’s investment policy statement. Information about the investment managers is shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nGatchell is reviewing the fee structures proposed by the three investment managers. He finds the following reference in Sonera’s investment policy statement: The fee structure must be easy to understand and avoid undue complexity wherever possible. Also, the fee structure must be predictable, so Sonera can reasonably forecast these costs on a yearly basis as an input to the annual budgeting process. He understands there are many different fee structures, and he wants to make sure he chooses the most appropriate one for the Sonera. Gatchell prepares a recommendation for the investment policy committee regarding the most appropriate fee structure. Sonera has followed an active investment style for many years. Gatchell would like to recommend to the investment policy committee that a portion of the funds be invested using a passive investment style. His research shows there are a number of methods used to weight the stocks in an index, each having its own characteristics. The one key feature he believes is important is that the method chosen not be biased toward small-capitalization stocks.\n\nGatchell is also examining different ways to establish passive equity exposure. He states to Lafite: There are a number of ways to get passive equity exposure; we can invest in an equity index mutual fund, a stock index futures contract, or a total return equity swap. Stock index futures and equity swaps are low-cost alternatives to equity index mutual funds; however, a drawback of stock index futures is that they have to be rolled over periodically. One advantage of investing in equity mutual funds is that shares can be redeemed at any point during the trading day. Gatchell is reviewing the performance of another investment manager, Far North, which uses a value-oriented approach and specializes in the Canadian market. Gatchell would like to recommend to the investment policy committee that the fund diversify geographically. The information for Far North and the related returns are shown in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\n\nThe investment policy committee reviews the information in Exhibit 2 and is not familiar with the terms “true active return” and “misfit active return.” Gatchell responds with the following statement: The true active return is the return Far North made above its normal benchmark return. The misfit active return is the return Far North made above the investor’s benchmark return. The term “investor’s benchmark” refers to the benchmark the investor uses to evaluate performance for a given portfolio or asset class.",

Packer College is a small liberal arts college whose endowment is managed by B&W. Lehigh is considering a number of derivative strategies to tactically adjust the Packer portfolio to reflect specific investment viewpoints discussed at a meeting with Packer’s investment committee. At the meeting, the committee reviews Packer’s current portfolio, whose characteristics are shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nKemal Gulen, a member of the investment committee, asks Lehigh how she manages the risk exposure of the call options investment. Lehigh responds by stating that she ensures that her call option positions are delta hedged. She notes, however, that in some instances, at an option’s expiration, the option gamma is very high and maintaining a delta hedged position becomes very difficult. Lehigh intends to synthetically modify the duration of the corporate bond component of the portfolio to a target of 3.0 in anticipation of rising interest rates. Interest rate swap data are provided in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nLehigh notes the holding of Mountain Hawk common stock. The shares were recently donated by an alumnus who mandated that they not be sold for three years. Lehigh provides three potential options strategies to use in order to benefit from changes in Mountain Hawk’s stock price, which is presently $100.00. Options strategies are provided in Exhibit 3.\n\n<image_3>\n\n\nLehigh tells the committee she believes US large-cap stocks will perform well over the next year. The committee agrees and wants B&W to adjust the beta of the US large-cap part of the portfolio to a target of 1.10 by purchasing large-cap futures contracts. Lehigh proposes purchasing 15 contracts. For each contract, the beta is 1.00 and the price is $100,000. The committee is concerned that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis may lead to volatility in European stock markets and the euro currency. It considers the hedging strategies outlined in Exhibit 4\n\n<image_4>\n\nFinally, Lehigh discusses B&W’s market view that over the next 24 months, mid-cap stocks will underperform small-cap stocks and the Libor rate will be less than the percentage increase in the small-cap index but greater than the percentage change in the mid-cap index. She recommends executing a swap transaction in order to alter the stock and bond allocation and thus capture the economic benefit of B&W’s market view. The investment committee considers the swap strategies outlined in Exhibit 5.\n\n<image_5>",

        "context": "Manuel Silva is a principal at Raintree Partners, a financial advisory firm, and a specialist in providing advice on risk management and trading strategies using derivatives. Raintree’s clients include high-net-worth individuals, corporations, banks, hedge funds, and other financial market participants. One of Silva’s clients, Iria Sampras, is meeting with Silva to discuss the use of options in her portfolio. Silva has collected information on S&P 500 Index options, which is shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Sampras states: “My investment in Eagle Corporation stock has increased considerably in value, and I would like suggestions on options strategies I can use to protect my gains.” Silva responds: There are two strategies that you may want to consider: covered calls or protective puts. Covered calls provide a way to protect your gains in Eagle Corporation stock. Adding a short call to your long position in Eagle stock will provide protection against losses on the stock position, but it will also limit upside gains. A protective put also provides downside protection, but it retains upside potential. Unlike covered calls, protective puts require an upfront premium payment. At the end of the meeting, Sampras asks Silva to provide a written analysis of the following option strategies: Strategy A: A butterfly spread strategy using the options information provided in Exhibit 1. Strategy B: A straddle strategy using the options in Exhibit 1 with an exercise price of $1,125. Strategy C: A collar strategy using the options information in Exhibit 1. On 16 March 2012, First Citizen Bank (FCB) approached Silva for advice on a loan commitment. At that time, FCB had committed to lend $100 million in 30 days (on 15 April 2012), with interest and principal due on 12 October 2012, or 180 days from the date of the loan. The interest rate on the loan was 180-day Libor + 50 bps, and FCB was concerned about interest rates declining between March and April. Silva advised FCB to purchase a $100 million interest rate put on 180-day Libor with an exercise rate of 5.75% and expiring on 15 April 2012. The put premium was $25,000. Libor rates on 16 March 2012 and 15 April 2012 were 6% and 4%, respectively. The option was exercised on 15 April 2012, and the payoff was received on 12 October 2012. FCB has asked for a written evaluation of the success of the strategy. On 15 October 2013, another client, Short Hills Corporation (SHC), indicates it expects to take out a $25 million dollar loan on 15 December 2013. The loan rate is 90-day Libor + 100 bps. Interest and principal will be paid on 15 March 2014, 90 days after the loan is made on 15 December 2013. SHC is concerned about rising interest rates and has approached Silva for recommendations on addressing this issue. On Silva’s advice, SHC purchases a $25 million interest rate call on 90-day Libor with an exercise rate of 3.5%. The option premium is $45,000, and it expires in 61 days, on 15 December 2013. If the option is exercised on 15 December 2013, the payoff will be received on 15 March 2014. SHC has asked Silva to provide a report on possible outcomes relative to potential interest rate scenarios.",

        "context": "Kamiko Watanabe, is a portfolio adviser at Wakasa Bay Securities. She specializes in the use of derivatives to alter and manage the exposures of Japanese equity and fixed-income portfolios. She has meetings today with two clients, Isao Sato and Reiko Kondo. Sato is the manager of the Tsushima Manufacturing pension fund, which has a target asset allocation of 60% equity and 40% bonds. The fund has separate equity and fixed-income portfolios, whose characteristics are provided in Exhibits 1 and 2. Sato expects equity values to increase in the coming two years and, in order to avoid substantial transaction costs now and in two years, would like to use derivatives to temporarily rebalance the portfolio. He wants to maintain the current beta of the equity portfolio and the current duration of the bond portfolio.\n\n<image_1>\n<image_2>\nIn order to rebalance the pension fund to its target allocations to equity and bonds, Watanabe recommends using Nikkei 225 Index futures contracts, which have a beta of 1.05 and a current contract price of ¥1,525,000, and Nikko Bond Performance Index futures, which have a duration of 6.90 and a current contract price of ¥4,830,000. She assumes the cash position has a duration of 0.25. Sato wants to know if other derivatives could be used to rebalance the portfolio. In response, Watanabe describes the characteristics of a pair of swaps that, together, would accomplish the same rebalancing as the proposed futures contracts strategy. Kondo manages a fixed-income portfolio for the Akito Trust. The portfolio’s market value is ¥640 million, and its duration is 6.40. Kondo believes interest rates will rise and asks Watanabe to explain how to use a swap to decrease the portfolio’s duration to 3.50. Watanabe proposes a strategy that uses a pay-fixed position in a three-year interest rate swap with semi-annual payments. Kondo decides he wants to use a four-year swap to manage the portfolio’s duration. After some calculations, Watanabe tells him a pay-fixed position in a four-year interest rate swap with a duration of –2.875 would require a notional principal of ¥683 million (rounded to the nearest million yen) to achieve his goals.\n\nKondo asks Watanabe whether it would be possible to cancel the swap prior to its maturity. Watanabe responds with three statements: Statement 1: If you purchase a swaption from the same counterparty as the original swap, it is common to require the payments of the two swaps be netted or cash settled if the swaption is exercised. Statement 2: You could purchase a payer swaption with the same terms as the original swap. This approach would protect you from falling fixed swap rates but at the cost of the premium you would pay to the swaption counterparty. Statement 3: During the life of the swap, you could enter into a new pay-floating swap with the same terms as the original swap, except it would have a maturity equal to the remaining maturity of the original swap. However, the fixed rate you receive might be lower than the fixed rate you are paying on the original swap.",

The duration of the fixed-rate bond is approximately 75% of the maturity, and the swap is short this duration. The duration of the floating-rate bond is approximately half its repricing frequency, and the swap is long this duration. Therefore, the duration of the three-year swap with semi-annual payments is (0.5 × 0.5) – (0.75 × 3) = –2.00.",

        "context": "REDD Partners specializes in forecasting and consulting in particular sectors of the equity market. Minglu Li is an analyst for REDD and specializes in the consumer credit industry. Last year (2012), Li and her team gathered data to determine the expected return for the industry, shown in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nAfter considering a number of approaches, Li and her team decided to use the bond-yield-plus-risk-premium method. The method had worked well in 2012, but a new assignment presented to Li’s team the previous week posed a new challenge.\nA new consumer credit mechanism was being tested on a small scale using a smartphone application to pay for items instead of the traditional credit card. The application had proved successful in the use of microloans in developing countries and was now being applied to a much broader consumer base. The new challenge for Li’s team is to develop a model for the expected return for these new consumer credit companies, which are called “smart credit” companiesbecause they combine the consumer credit industry and what had traditionally been considered the telecommunications industry.\nAlthough smart credit company returns data are sparse, a five-year monthly equally weighted index called the “Smart Credit Index” (SCI) was created from the existing companies’ returns data. The number of companies in the index at a given time varies because of firms failing and also merging over time.\nThe SCI risk premium, equal to the SCI return minus the risk-free rate, denoted as SCIRP, is used as the dependent variable in a two-factor regression in which the independent variables are index returns minus the risk-free rate for the consumer credit industry (CCIRP) and the telecommunications industry (TELIRP). The regression results are in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nAlthough volatility information is available from the SCI data and correspondingly for the SCIRP, Li’s team wants to determine the statistical relationship between the SCIRP and both the CCIRP and the TELIRP because forecasting the CCIRP and TELIRP is much less difficult than forecasting the SCIRP. After some discussion, the team believes that the volatility measure for the SCIRP data based on the volatility of CCIRP and TELIRP through the regression should be adjusted to incorporate a correlation coefficient of 0.25 between the CCIRP and TELIRP. Although the two index risk premiums were uncorrelated in the past and within the regression, Li’s team believes the two technologies will become more correlated in the future.\nLi’s team also examined survey data within the consumer credit and telecommunications industries over the same time period for which the actual data were collected. They found that projections in the surveys of the CCI and TELI tended to be more volatile than the actual data. However, Li’s team has decided not to make any adjustments because a definitive procedure could not be determined.\nGiven the effect of short-term interest rates on consumer credit, Li’s team then decided to determine what the short-term interest rate is expected to be in the future. The central bank’s last official statement identified 2.5% as the appropriate rate, assuming no other factors. Li’s team then estimates potential factors that may make the central bank behave differently from the 2.5% rate in the statement, shown in Exhibit 3.\n\n\n<image_3>\n\n\nBased on Taylor’s rule, with an assumption of equal weights applied to forecast versus trend measures, the short-term rate is expected to increase from the current 1.23%, and the yield curve is expected to flatten.\nFor further insight, Li decides to consult an in-house expert on central banking, Randy Tolliver. Tolliver states that a flat yield curve is consistent with tight monetary policies and tight fiscal policies.",

        "context": "Brian O'Reilly is a capital markets consultant for the Tennessee Teachers' Retirement System (TTRS). O'Reilly is meeting with the TTRS board to present his capital market expectations for the next year. Board member Kay Durden asks O'Reilly about the possibility that data measurement biases exist in historical data. O'Reilly responds:\nSome benchmark indexes suffer from survivorship bias. For example, the returns of failed or merged companies are dropped from the data series, resulting in an upward bias to reported returns. This bias may result in an overly optimistic expectation with respect to future index returns. Another bias results from the use of appraisal data in the absence of market transaction data. Appraisal values tend to be less volatile than market determined values for identical assets. The result is that calculated correlations with other assets tend to be biased upward in absolute value compared with the true correlations, and the true variance of the asset is biased downward.\nBoard member Arnold Brown asks O'Reilly about the use of high-frequency (daily) data in developing capital market expectations. O'Reilly answers, \"Sometimes it is necessary to use daily data to obtain a dataseries of the desired length. High-frequency data are more sensitive to asynchronism across variables and, as a result, tend to produce higher correlation estimates.\"\nBoard member Harold Melson notes he recently read an article on psychological traps related to making accurate and unbiased forecasts. He asks O'Reilly to inform the board about the anchoring trap and the confirming evidence trap. O'Reilly offers the following explanation:\nThe anchoring trap is the tendency for forecasts to be overly influenced by the memory of catastrophic or dramatic past events that are anchored in a person's memory. The confirming evidence trap is the bias that leads individuals to give greater weight to information that supports a preferred viewpoint than to evidence that contradicts it.\nThe board asks O'Reilly about using a multifactor model to estimate asset returns and covariances among asset returns. O'Reilly presents the factor covariance matrix for global equity and global bonds shown in Exhibit 1 and market factor sensitivities and residual risk shown in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_1>\n\nFinally, the board asks about forecasting expected returns for major markets, given that price earnings ratios are not constant over time and that many companies are repurchasing shares instead of increasing cash dividends. O'Reilly responds that the Grinold–Kroner model accounts for those factors and then makes the following forecasts for the European equity market:\n• The dividend yield will be 1.95%.\n• Shares outstanding will decline 1.00%.\n• The long-term inflation rate will be 1.75% per year.\n• An expansion rate for P/E multiples will be 0.15% per year.\n• The long-term corporate earnings growth premium will be 1% above GDP growth.\n• GDP growth will be 2.5% per year.\n• The risk-free rate will be 2.5%.",

Dan McKeen manages the semiactive equity portfolios and the semiactive derivatives portfolios. They are preparing to meet with Maggie Smith, the chief investment officer of Philaburgh Capital, who is considering hiring MCAM to replace one of its current managers.\nAt the meeting, Morris and McKeen discuss MCAM’s investment approaches with Smith and present her with the risk and return characteristics detailed in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nSmith asks if MCAM’s active equity strategy is long only. McKeen responds that MCAM uses market-neutral long–short strategies for several reasons. He indicates that long–short strategies:\nReason 1: enhance portfolio performance by increasing the beta.\nReason 2: generate alpha by identifying undervalued or overvalued securities.\nReason 3: benefit from events that give rise to price changes, which are more prevalent on the short side than on the long side.\nSmith considers each approach listed in Exhibit 1 but is uncertain about what would be an optimal investment strategy. She makes the following comments about market efficiency:\nComment 1: A firm’s stock price does not reflect all publicly available company information, and good research can uncover sound investment opportunities.\nComment 2: Philaburgh’s mandate is for managers to limit volatility around the benchmark return while providing incremental returns that exceed management costs.\nSmith states, “In order to ensure investment discipline, Philaburgh uses two methods to evaluate an investment manager’s style.” She then reviews the current characteristics of MCAM’s active equity approach using the first method, as presented in Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nSmith then selects three benchmarks—value, blend, and growth—in addition to the normal benchmark to assess the manager’s style using the second method, as presented in Exhibit 3.\n\n<image_3>\n\nSmith indicates that Philaburgh’s performance measurement is compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards. In considering investment performance, Morris identifies three risks that may prevent MCAM’s active equity approach from generating incremental returns:\nRisk 1: Overestimating a stock’s earnings per share growth.\nRisk 2: Deciding incorrectly that a stock’s earnings multiple would not contract.\nRisk 3: Misjudging whether a stock’s undervaluation will correct within the investor’s investment horizon.\nSmith concludes by telling Morris that she is impressed by MCAM’s track record in adding alpha in the US stock market. However, she believes that the European equity markets are likely to outperform the US equity markets over the next five years. She asks whether MCAM can structure a portfolio to capture both opportunities. Morris offers to combine his long–short active equity strategy with a EURO STOXX 50 Index strategy.",

        "context": "Aina Monts, is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Girona Advisors. She has been awarded the management of a €150 million portfolio for Fondo de Pensiones Lerida, a pension fund based in Barcelona, Spain. The previous manager was fired for underperforming the benchmark by more than 100 bps in each of the last three years. Lerida’s primary objective is to immunize its liabilities, which have a duration of 4.40 years, while achieving a total rate of return in excess of the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index. The benchmark’s duration is currently 4.42 years. At Girona’s portfolio review meeting, Monts makes the following statement:\nStatement 1: We will invest the €150 million in a multi-sector portfolio with a yield to maturity of 6.75%. This rate is higher than Lerida’s required rate of return of 6.25%. The duration of the portfolio will be equal to the duration of the liabilities, and we will manage the portfolio with an expectation of beating the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index.\nExhibit 1 presents key characteristics of Lerida’s portfolio for the current period compared with one year ago. Because rates have shifted over this period, Monts informs Lerida that an additional investment must be made to rebalance the portfolio and reestablish the original dollar duration. Monts plans to rebalance using the existing security proportions.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nMonts will rebalance the portfolio by investing in securities that her research group has identified as providing the most attractive total return potential. Sector allocations for her\nportfolio and the benchmark are presented in Exhibit 2.\n\n\n<image_2>\n\nMonts will rebalance the portfolio by investing in securities that her research group has identified as providing the most attractive total return potential. Sector allocations for her portfolio and the benchmark are presented in Exhibit 2.\nMonts also uses security selection in addition to sector rotation as sources of alpha and is evaluating several new trades. At the portfolio review meeting, Monts makes the following statements:\nStatement 2: I am concerned that certain types of securities in the portfolio pose a risk of not providing sufficient cash flow to pay liabilities when they are due. The allocation to mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio, for instance, exposes us to contingent claims risk. We should thus increase the allocation to non-callable fixed-rate corporate bonds, which do not expose us to contingent claims risk.\nStatement 3: Our research team anticipates that the credit fundamentals of most issuers will deteriorate over the coming months as the economy contracts. The market consensus is not in line with our view yet, and spreads do not reflect the proper valuation.\nStatement 4: Structural analysis of corporate bonds is a key part of our research process. Given Girona’s view that interest rates are in secular decline, we expect callable bonds to outperform bullets. In the event that interest rates rise sharply, put structures will provide investors with some protection.",

Quest states the justification for the allocation: “I believe that the alternative investments we have provide good liquidity and strong portfolio diversification for the remainder of the portfolio, which consists of equities and fixed income.”\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nDPAM is the manager of a managed futures fund that seeks to achieve a positive absolute return. DPAM’s chief investment officer, Randall Duke, is preparing a report for his first meeting with WM’s investment committee. Knowing that WM’s investment committee is less familiar with real assets than with equities and fixed income, he includes the following exhibits. Exhibit 2 shows information on DPAM’s portfolio positions in Canadian dollars (C$).\n\n<image_2>\n\n\nExhibit 3 provides information on current delivery month prices of selected commodity contracts.\n\n<image_3>\n\nDuke calls Quest to ensure that his report addresses any questions the committee may have.\nQuest tells him,\nThere are a few questions we would like you to address in your report:\nQuestion 1. Could you explain why using managed futures is more beneficial to us than using an unleveraged exchange-listed commodity index fund?\nQuestion 2. The endowment has to support WM’s long-term operation, which has seen its costs rising steadily over the past decade. In view of that, would it not be better for our managed futures portfolio to have a larger weighting in energy commodities, such as the crude oil position, and to eliminate agricultural commodities, such as wheat?\nQuestion 3. Some of the committee members are considering adding commodities and other alternative investments to their own personal portfolios. We know you are knowledgeable about the institutional investment due diligence process. From the perspective of private investors, what due diligence questions would our members have in common with the WM endowment?\nDuke answers:\nMy report already answers your first question. In answer to Question 2, I believe the retention of agricultural commodities in the portfolio can be justified as follows:\nJustification 1: Agricultural commodities can increase expected return relative to a portfolio composed of only traditional investments.\nJustification 2: Agricultural commodities typically provide an expected offset to losses in such assets as conventional debt instruments in times of unexpected inflation.\nJustification 3: Agricultural commodities are a natural source of return, reflecting economic fundamentals over the long term.\n\n\nIf the committee members want to personally invest in alternative investments, the following are due diligence considerations that must be evaluated by both institutional and private investors:\nConsideration 1: Market opportunity\nConsideration 2: Determine suitability\nConsideration 3: Potential for decision risk.",

        "context": "Beatriz Anton is the chief compliance officer at Long Pond Advisers, an asset management firm catering to institutional investors. Long Pond is not currently GIPS compliant, but Anton would like to market the firm as being compliant as soon as possible. To assist Anton in achieving compliance, she hires Ana Basco from Nantucket Advisers to provide guidance on achieving compliance.\nAt their initial meeting to discuss a framework for the implementation of GIPS standards, Anton asks Basco what she believes the fundamentals of GIPS compliance encompass. Basco responds,\nA good starting point is input data because the Standards rely on the integrity of input data to accurately calculate results. Portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value, not cost or book values. In fact, fair value supersedes market value. Transactions are reflected in the portfolio at settlement when the exchange of cash, securities, and paperwork involved in a transaction is completed. Accrual accounting is used for fixed-income securities and all other assets that accrue interest income; dividend-paying equities accrue dividends on the ex-dividend date.\nBasco then asks Anton about Long Pond’s policies for return calculation methodologies. Anton responds that she has recently implemented the following polices:\nPolicy 1: Total return is calculated for portfolios using time-weighted rates of return computed by geometrically linking the periodic returns. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are used in the calculation.\nPolicy 2: Large- and mid-cap equity portfolios are revalued on the date when capital equal to 10% or more of current market value is contributed or withdrawn. Small-cap and fixed-income portfolios use a 5% threshold.\nPolicy 3: Cash and cash equivalents are excluded in total return calculations. Custody fees are not considered direct transaction costs. Returns are calculated after deduction of trading expenses.\nTheir conversation turns to the construction of composites and composite return calculations. Anton tells Basco:\nLong Pond calculates composite returns by asset weighting the individual portfolio returns using beginning-of-period values. For periods beginning 1 January 2010, we calculate composite returns by asset weighting the individual portfolio returns quarterly. All actual fee-paying, discretionary portfolios are included in at least one composite. Non-fee-paying discretionary portfolios are also included in a composite, and appropriate disclosures are provided. Client portfolios that restrict the purchase of certain securities are excluded if this restriction hinders the portfolio manager’s ability to execute the investment strategy. We consider a hierarchical structure of criteria for composite definition that promotes primary and secondary strategy characteristics, such as asset classes, styles, benchmarks, and risk/return characteristics. The composites are not always defined according to each level of the hierarchy.\nAnton then provides Basco with a recent presentation to a prospective client for Long Pond’s mid-capitalization composite. Details of this presentation are found in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\n\nNotes:\n1. Long Pond is an independent investment firm founded in May 1998 and has a single office in Seattle, WA. The firm manages portfolios in various equity, fixed-income, and real estate strategies.\n2. The composite has an inception date of 31 December 2001. A complete list and description of firm composites is available on request.\n3. The composite includes all fee-paying discretionary, non-taxable portfolios that follow a mid-cap strategy. The composite does not include any non-fee-paying portfolios.\n4. First quarter 2013 (1Q13) data are not annualized.\n5. Valuations are computed and performance reported in US dollars.\n6. Internal dispersion is calculated using the equal-weighted standard deviation of all portfolios that were included in the composite for the entire year.\n7. Gross-of-fees performance returns are presented before management and custodial fees but after all trading expenses. The management fee schedule is as follows: 1.00% on first $25 million; 0.60% thereafter. Net-of-fees performance returns are calculated by deducting the management fee of 0.25% from the monthly gross composite return.\nAnton concludes by describing Long Pond’s real estate composite valuation practices to Basco:\nSince 1 January 2011, Long Pond uses fair value for real estate holdings calculated annually and has an external expert value the properties every 36 months. For periods before 1 January 2011, however, we used market values. We calculate income returns and capital returns separately using geometrically linked time-weighted rates of return and composite returns by asset-weighting the individual portfolio returns at least quarterly.",

Mayer meets with Sebastian Capara, the newly appointed Investment Committee chairman for the Kinkardeen University Endowment (KUE), a very large tax-exempt fund.\n\nCapara and Mayer review KUE’s current and strategic asset allocations, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Capara informs Mayer that over the last few years, Kinkardeen University has financed its operations primarily from tuition, with minimal need of financial support from KUE. Enrollment at the University has been rising in recent years, and the Board of Trustees expects enrollment growth to continue for the next five years. Consequently, the board expects very modest endowment support to be needed during that time. These expectations led the Investment Committee to approve a decrease in the endowment’s annual spending rate starting in the next fiscal year.\n<image_1>\nAs an additional source of alpha, Mayer proposes tactically adjusting KUE’s asset-class weights to profit from short-term return opportunities. To confirm his understanding of tactical asset allocation (TAA), Capara tells Mayer the following:\n\nStatement 1 The Sharpe ratio is suitable for measuring the success of TAA relative to SAA.\nStatement 2 Discretionary TAA attempts to capture asset-class-level return anomalies that have been shown to have some predictability and persistence.\nStatement 3 TAA allows a manager to deviate from the IPS asset-class upper and lower limits if the shift is expected to produce higher expected risk-adjusted returns.\n\nCapara asks Mayer to recommend a TAA strategy based on excess return forecasts for the asset classes in KUE’s portfolio, as shown in Exhibit 2.\n<image_2>\nFollowing her consultation with Capara, Mayer meets with Roger Koval, a member\nof a wealthy family. Although Koval’s baseline needs are secured by a family trust,\nKoval has a personal portfolio to fund his lifestyle goals.\nIn Koval’s country, interest income is taxed at progressively higher income tax rates.\nDividend income and long-term\ncapital gains are taxed at lower tax rates relative to\ninterest and earned income. In taxable accounts, realized capital losses can be used to\noffset current or future realized capital gains. Koval is in a high tax bracket, and his\ntaxable account currently holds, in equal weights, high-yield\nbonds, investment-grade\nbonds, and domestic equities focused on long-term\ncapital gains.\nKoval asks Mayer about adding new asset classes to the taxable portfolio. Mayer\nsuggests emerging markets equity given its positive short-term\nexcess return forecast.\nHowever, Koval tells Mayer he is not interested in adding emerging markets equity to\nthe account because he is convinced it is too risky. Koval justifies this belief by referring\nto significant losses the family trust suffered during the recent economic crisis.\nMayer also suggests using two mean–variance portfolio optimization scenarios\nfor the taxable account to evaluate potential asset allocations. Mayer recommends\nrunning two optimizations: one on a pre-tax\nbasis and another on an after-tax\nbasis.",

Singh gathers the\ninformation in Exhibit-1 to explore various strategies to address Hopewell’s concerns.\nAnother client, Nigel French, is a trader who does not currently own shares of\nWalnut Corporation. French has told Singh that he believes that Walnut shares will\nexperience a large move in price after the upcoming quarterly earnings release in two\nweeks. French also tells Singh, however, that he is unsure which direction the stock\nwill move.

The market price for the $70 strike put option is $3.70, and the market price for the $65 strike put option is $1.34 per share. Thus, the initial net cost of the bear spread position is $3.70 – $1.34 = $2.36 per share. If Walnut shares are $66 at expiration, the $70 strike put option is in the money by $4.00, and the short position in the $65 strike put expires worthless. After deducting the cost of $2.36 to initiate the bear spread position, the net profit is $1.64 per contract.",

The research report concludes that the consensus forecast of the implied volatility of index options is too low and anticipates greater-than- expected volatility over the next month.

If the future NIFTY 50 Index level rises above its current level plus the combined cost of the call and put premiums, Ahlim would exercise the call option and realize a profit. Similarly, if the index level falls below the current index level minus the combined cost of the call and put premiums, Ahlim would exercise the put option and realize a profit. Thus, Ahlim profits if the index moves either up or down enough to pay for the call and put premiums. B is incorrect because the strategy to buy a call option would be reasonable given an increase in expected implied volatility with a bullish NIFTY 50 Index forecast, not a neutral trading range.

After analyzing global financial markets, Konstanze Ostermann,\na portfolio manager at Guten Investments, now expects that this correlation will\nincrease to +0.80, although her forecast for foreign-currency\nasset returns is unchanged.\nOstermann believes that currency markets are efficient and hence that long-run\ngains cannot be achieved from active currency management, especially after netting\nout management and transaction costs.

        "explanation": "C is correct. The domestic-currency\nreturn is a function of the foreign-currency\nreturn and the percentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic\ncurrency. Mathematically, the domestic-currency\nreturn is expressed as:\n$R_DC = (1 + R_FC)(1 + R_FX) – 1$\nwhere $R_DC$ is the domestic-currency\nreturn (in percent), $R_FC$ is the foreign-currency\nreturn, and $R_FX$ is the percentage change of the foreign currency\nagainst the domestic currency. Note that this RFX expression is calculated using\nthe investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the price currency\nin the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard\ncurrency quotes\nin Exhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes.\nTherefore, for the foreign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against\nthe EUR, the market-standard\nquote (USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR,\nrespectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.\nThe Euro-Swiss\n(CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from\n1.2175 to 1.2080), meaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/\nEUR rate decreased). Or put differently, the CHF appreciated against the EUR,\nadding to the EUR-denominated\nreturn for the German investor holding CHF-denominated\nassets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency\nreturn\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency\nreturn (RFC)\nfor the CHF-denominated\nassets. Both the Euro-dollar\n(USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning\nthe EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the USD/EUR rate and the\nGBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency\nreturn (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency\nreturn\n(RFC) for the USD- and GBP-denominated\nassets.",

Inflation-linked bonds protect against inflation by paying a return that is directly linked to an index of consumer prices and adjusting the principal for inflation. Inflation-linked bonds protect both coupon and principal payments against inflation. The level of inflation protection for coupons equals the percentage of the portfolio in floating-coupon bonds plus the percentage of the portfolio in inflation-linked bonds: Aschel = 2% + 3% = 5%. Permot = 34% + 28% = 62%. Rosaiso = 17% + 21% = 38%. Thus, Permot has the highest level of inflation protection, with 62% of its portfolio in floating-coupon and inflation-linked bonds.",

        "explanation": "C is correct. The Barboa Fund invests solely in the equity of companies in the oil production and transportation industries in many countries. The fund’s description is consistent with the production-oriented approach, which groups companies that manufacture similar products or use similar inputs in their manufacturing processes. A is incorrect because the fund description does not mention the firms’ size or style (i.e., value, growth, or blend). Size is typically measured by market capitalization and often categorized as large cap, mid-cap, or small cap. Style is typically classified as value, growth, or a blend of value and growth. In addition, style is often determined through a “scoring” system that incorporates multiple metrics or ratios, such as price-to- book ratios, price-to- earnings ratios, earnings growth, dividend yield, and book value growth. These metrics are then typically “scored” individually for each company, assigned certain weights, and then aggregated. B is incorrect because the fund is invested across many countries, which indicates that the fund is not segmented by geography. Segmentation by geography is typically based upon the stage of countries’ macroeconomic development and wealth. Common geographic categories are developed markets, emerging markets, and frontier markets.",

        "context": "Evan Winthrop, a senior officer of a US-based\ncorporation, meets with Rebecca\nTong, a portfolio manager at Cobalt Wealth Management. Winthrop recently moved\nhis investments to Cobalt in response to his previous manager’s benchmark-relative\nunderperformance and high expenses.\nWinthrop resides in Canada and plans to retire there. His annual salary covers\nhis current spending needs, and his vested defined benefit pension plan is sufficient\nto meet retirement income goals. Winthrop prefers passive exposure to global equity\nmarkets with a focus on low management costs and minimal tracking error to any\nindex benchmarks. The fixed-income\nportion of the portfolio may consist of laddered\nmaturities with a home-country\nbias.\nTong proposes using an equity index as a basis for an investment strategy and\nreviews the most important requirements for an appropriate benchmark. With regard\nto investable indexes, Tong tells Winthrop the following:\nStatement 1 A free-float\nadjustment to a market-capitalization\nweighted index\nlowers its liquidity.\nStatement 2 An index provider that incorporates a buffering policy makes the\nindex more investable.\nWinthrop asks Tong to select a benchmark for the domestic stock allocation that\nholds all sectors of the Canadian equity market and to focus the portfolio on highly\nliquid, well-known\ncompanies. In addition, Winthrop specifies that any stock purchased\nshould have a relatively low beta, a high dividend yield, a low P/E, and a low\nprice-to-\nbook\nratio (P/B).\nWinthrop and Tong agree that only the existing equity investments need to be\nliquidated. Tong suggests that, as an alternative to direct equity investments, the new\nequity portfolio be composed of the exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs) shown in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nWinthrop asks Tong about the techniques wealth managers and fund companies\nuse to create index-tracking\nequity portfolios that minimize tracking error and costs.\nIn response, Tong outlines two frequently used methods:\n\nMethod 1 One process requires that all index constituents are available for\ntrading and liquid, but significant brokerage commissions can occur\nwhen the index is large.\nMethod 2 When tracking an index with a large number of constituents and/\nor managing a relatively low level of assets, a relatively straightforward\nand technically unsophisticated method can be used to build\na passive portfolio that requires fewer individual securities than the\nindex and reduces brokerage commission costs.\nTong adds that portfolio stocks may be used to generate incremental revenue,\nthereby partially offsetting administrative costs but potentially creating undesirable\ncounterparty and collateral risks.\nAfter determining Winthrop’s objectives and constraints, the CAD147 million\nportfolio’s new strategic policy is to target long-term\nmarket returns while being fully\ninvested at all times. Tong recommends quarterly rebalancing, currency hedging, and\na composite benchmark composed of equity and fixed-income\nindexes. Currently the\nUSD is worth CAD1.2930, and this exchange rate is expected to remain stable during\nthe next month. Exhibit 2 presents the strategic asset allocation and benchmark weights.\n<image_2>\nIn one month, Winthrop will receive a performance bonus of USD5,750,000. He\nbelieves that the US equity market is likely to increase during this timeframe. To take\nadvantage of Winthrop’s market outlook, he instructs Tong to immediately initiate an\nequity transaction using the S&P 500 futures contract with a current price of 2,464.29\nwhile respecting the policy weights in Exhibit 2. The S&P 500 futures contract multiplier\nis 250, and the S&P 500 E-mini\nmultiplier is 50.\nTong cautions Winthrop that there is a potential pitfall with the proposed request\nwhen it comes time to analyze performance. She discloses to Winthrop that equity\nindex futures returns can differ from the underlying index, primarily because of corporate\nactions such as the declaration of dividends and stock splits.",

In contrast, portfolios managed using a fundamental approach usually monitor the portfolio’s holdings continuously and may increase, decrease, or eliminate positions at any time. Also, the focus of a quantitative approach is on factors across a potentially large group of stocks, whereas fundamental strategies focus on a relatively small group of stocks. Consequently, Heydon’s new quantitative fund will likely hold a larger number of stocks than the existing equity fund. Finally, managers following a fundamental approach typically select stocks by performing extensive research on individual companies; thus, fundamental investors see risk at the company level. In contrast, with a quantitative approach, the risk is that factor returns will not perform as expected. Because the quantitative approach invests in baskets of stocks, the risks lie at the portfolio level rather than at the level of specific stocks (company level). Consequently, Nowacki’s new quantitative fund will likely see risk at the portfolio level, rather than the company level as the existing equity fund does.",

In contrast, fundamental analysis (not quantitative analysis) emphasizes forecasting future prospects, including the future earnings and cash flows of a company.",

As the new fund scales up active risk by doubling active weights, it will face implementation constraints that will prevent it from increasing the weights of many of its short positions. The information ratio (IR) is defined as the ratio of active return to active risk. If there were no constraints preventing the new fund from scaling up active weights, it could scale up active risk by scaling up active weights, proportionally increase active return, and keep the IR unchanged. Implementation constraints experienced by the new fund, however, such as the cost and difficulty in borrowing securities to support the scaled-up short positions, will prevent the active return from proportionally increasing with the active risk. Therefore, the IR would most likely be lower for the new fund than for Fund 1. As the following chart illustrates, as active risk is scaled up, implementation constraints create diminishing returns to scale for active returns, thereby degrading the IR.",

The maximum position size for PC under each constraint is calculated as follows: Liquidity Constraint Dollar value of PC traded daily = PC market cap × Average daily trading volume Dollar value of PC traded daily = $3 billion × 1.0% = $30 million Liquidity constraint = Dollar value of PC traded daily × Liquidity % threshold Liquidity constraint = $30 million × 10% = $3 million Allocation Constraint Allocation constraint = AUM × Maximum position size threshold Allocation constraint = $250 million × 3.0% = $7.5 million Index Weight Constraint Index weight constraint = AUM × (Index weight × 10) Index weight constraint = $250 million × (0.20% × 10) = $5.0 million The liquidity constraint of $3.0 million is less than both the $5.0 million index weight constraint and the $7.5 million allocation constraint.

Portfolio X has lower absolute volatility and lower active risk than Portfolio Z, although both have similar costs. Finally, for managers with similar costs, fees, and alpha skills, if two products have similar active and absolute risks, the portfolio having a higher active share is preferred. Portfolio X has lower absolute volatility, lower active risk, and higher active share than Portfolio Z.

        "context": "Kevin Kroll is the chair of the investment committee responsible for the governance\nof the Shire Manufacturing Corporation (SMC) defined benefit pension plan. The\npension fund is currently fully funded and has followed an asset mix of 60% public\nequities and 40% bonds since Kroll has been chair. Kroll meets with Mary Park, an\nactuarial and pension consultant, to discuss issues raised at the last committee meeting.\nKroll notes that the investment committee would like to explore the benefits of\nadding alternative investments to the pension plan’s strategic asset allocation. Kroll\nstates:\nStatement 1 The committee would like to know which alternative asset would\nbest mitigate the risks to the portfolio due to unexpected inflation\nand also have a relatively low correlation with public equities\nto provide diversification benefits.\nThe SMC pension plan has been able to fund the annual pension payments without\nany corporate contributions for a number of years. The committee is interested in\npotential changes to the asset mix that could increase the probability of achieving\nthe long-term\ninvestment target return of 5.5% while maintaining the funded status\nof the plan. Park notes that fixed-income\nyields are expected to remain low for the\nforeseeable future. Kroll asks:\nStatement 2 If the public equity allocation remains at 60%, is there a single\nasset class that could be used for the balance of the portfolio\nto achieve the greatest probability of maintaining the pension\nfunding status over a long time horizon? Under this hypothetical\nscenario, the balance of the portfolio can be allocated to either\nbonds, hedge funds, or private equities.\nPark confirms with Kroll that the committee has historically used a traditional\napproach to define the opportunity set based on distinct macroeconomic regimes,\nand she proposes that a risk-based\napproach might be a better method. Although\nthe traditional approach is relatively powerful for its ability to handle liquidity and\nmanager selection issues compared to a risk-based\napproach, they both acknowledge\nthat a number of limitations are associated with the existing approach.\nPark presents a report (Exhibit 1) that proposes a new strategic asset allocation\nfor the pension plan. Kroll states that one of the concerns that the investment committee\nwill have regarding the new allocation is that the pension fund needs to be\nable to fund an upcoming early retirement incentive program (ERIP) that SMC will\nbe offering to its employees within the next two years. Employees who have reached\nthe age of 55 and whose age added to the number of years of company service sum to\n75 or more can retire 10 years early and receive the defined benefit pension normally\npayable at age 65.\n\n<image_1>\n\nKroll and Park then discuss suitability considerations related to the allocation in\nExhibit 1. Kroll understands that one of the drawbacks of including the proposed\nalternative asset classes is that daily reporting will no longer be available. Investment\nreports for alternatives will likely be received after monthly or quarter-end\ndeadlines\nused for the plan’s traditional investments. Park emphasizes that in a typical private\nequity structure, the pension fund makes a commitment of capital to a blind pool as\npart of the private investment partnership.\nIn order to explain the new strategic asset allocation to the investment committee,\nKroll asks Park why a risk factor-based\napproach should be used rather than a mean–\nvariance-optimization\ntechnique. Park makes the following statements:\nStatement 3 Risk factor-based\napproaches to asset allocation produce more\nrobust asset allocation proposals.\nStatement 4 A mean–variance optimization typically overallocates to the private\nalternative asset classes due to stale pricing.\nPark notes that the current macroeconomic environment could lead to a bear\nmarket within a few years. Kroll asks Park to discuss the potential impact on liquidity\nplanning associated with the actions of the fund’s general partners in the forecasted\nenvironment.\nKroll concludes the meeting by reviewing the information in Exhibit 2 pertaining\nto three potential private equity funds analyzed by Park. Park discloses the following\ndue diligence findings from a recent manager search: Fund A retains administrators,\ncustodians, and auditors with impeccable reputations; Fund B has achieved its performance\nin a manner that appears to conflict with its reported investment philosophy;\nand Fund C has recently experienced the loss of three key persons.\n<image_2>",

Real assets (which include energy, infrastructure, timber, commodities, and farmland) are generally believed to mitigate the risks to the portfolio arising from unexpected inflation. Commodities act as a hedge against a core constituent of inflation measures. Rather than investing directly in the actual commodities, commodity futures may be incorporated using a managed futures strategy. In addition, the committee is looking for an asset class that has a low correlation with public equities, which will provide diversification benefits. Commodities are regarded as having much lower correlation coefficients with public equities than with private equities and hedge funds. Therefore, commodities will provide the greatest potential to fulfill the indicated role and to diversify public equities.",

It is also important to monitor the investment process and the investment management firm itself, particularly in alternative investment structures. Considering the qualitative factors identified by Park, Fund A is the only fund with a strong, positive factor: It benefits from service providers (administrators, custodians, and auditors) with impeccable reputations. Fund B seems to be experiencing style drift, which suggests that the returns are not consistent with the manager’s advertised investment edge (hence, a negative factor). Fund C has experienced the departure of key persons, which puts future fund returns in jeopardy (hence, a negative factor).",

A third client, LaShawna Kaminski, lives in a tax jurisdiction\nwith a flat tax rate of 20%, which applies to all types of income and capital gains.\nPayne is the founder and sole owner of Solar Falls Power, a privately held renewable\nenergy company located in the United States. In addition to owning Solar Falls Power,\nPayne is also the sole owner of the property that the company uses as its headquarters.\nThe vast majority of Payne’s wealth is represented by these two assets. Payne’s tax cost\nbasis in each asset is close to zero.\nPayne consults with Chen to develop a strategy to mitigate the risk associated\nwith the two concentrated ownership positions. Payne’s primary objective is to mitigate\nthe concentration risk of both positions without triggering a taxable event while\nmaintaining sole ownership. Payne’s secondary objective is to monetize the property.\nPayne is considering becoming a resident of Singapore, which operates under a\nterritorial tax system, while maintaining her US citizenship. She contacts Chen to\ndiscuss tax implications related to the potential change in residency. She asks Chen\nthe following tax-related\nquestion:\nAs a US citizen, if I become a resident of Singapore, would I be taxed (1)\nonly on income earned where I am a resident, (2) only on income earned\nwhere I am a citizen, or (3) on all income earned worldwide?\nChen next advises Yoonim, who recently inherited shares of Steelworq from a\nrelative who passed away. Yoonim’s deceased relative was a resident of the United\nStates, which is a country that uses a “step-up”\nin basis at death. The deceased relative\npurchased the Steelworq shares 20 years ago for $14,900 (including commissions and\nother costs). At the time of the relative’s death, the Steelworq shares had a market\nvalue of $200,000, and Yoonim recently sold the shares for $180,000. Yoonim’s capital\ngains tax rate is 20%.\nYoonim seeks to diversify his portfolio by using the proceeds from the sale of\nSteelworq shares to invest in mutual funds. Yoonim’s investment adviser identifies\nthree mutual funds, and Yoonim asks Chen to determine which fund will be the most\ntax efficient going forward. Selected data for the three mutual funds is presented in\nExhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nYoonim next asks Chen to evaluate Mutual Fund D, which has an embedded gain\nof 5% of the ending portfolio value. Yoonim asks Chen to calculate a post-liquidation\nreturn over the most recent three-year\nperiod. Mutual Fund D exhibited after-tax\nreturns of 7.0% in Year 1, 3.3% in Year 2, and 7.5% in Year 3, and capital gains are\ntaxed at a 20% rate.\nFinally, Chen turns his attention to Kaminski, who currently has $1 million invested\nin a tax-deferred\naccount earning 7% per year.

        "explanation": "B is correct. Payne can obtain a personal loan secured by her private company\nshares in Solar Falls Power to meet her primary objective of mitigating the\nconcentration risk of both ownership positions without triggering a taxable\nevent while maintaining sole ownership. One of the key benefits is that this type\nof borrowing should not cause an immediate taxable event. Although at some\npoint the debt will need to be repaid, Payne would have access to cash to diversify\nher concentration risk while maintaining sole ownership of the company.\nA is incorrect because a leveraged recapitalization would not meet Payne’s\nprimary objective, since it would both trigger a taxable event and result in\nPayne not maintaining sole ownership of the company. In a typical leveraged\nrecapitalization, a private equity firm provides or arranges debt with senior and\nmezzanine lenders. The owner of the privately owned business receives cash for\na portion of her shares and retains a minority interest in the freshly capitalized\nentity. The owner is typically taxed currently on the cash received. If structured\nproperly, a tax deferral is achieved on the stock rolled over into the newly capitalized\ncompany.\nC is incorrect because establishing a charitable remainder trust using Solar Falls\nPower shares would involve Payne donating her shares to a trust and receiving\na tax deduction for the gift. However, this would result in Payne relinquishing\nsole ownership of Solar Falls Power, which would violate her primary objective\nto maintain sole ownership.",

        "explanation": "B is correct. Mortgage financing is a real estate monetization strategy that investors can use to reduce the concentration of a particular property and generate liquidity to diversify asset portfolios without triggering a taxable event or giving up sole ownership. Payne could monetize the property by obtaining a mortgage loan against the property, and the loan proceeds could then be reinvested in a diversified portfolio of securities. A is incorrect because in a donor-advised fund transaction, the property owner contributes the property to a donor-advised fund in exchange for a charitable contribution deduction. While this transaction would allow Payne to monetize the property with no tax liability, she would give up sole ownership of the property, and her primary objective includes maintaining sole ownership. C is incorrect because a sale and leaseback is a transaction in which the owner of a property sells the property to a new buyer and then immediately leases it back from the same buyer. The sale of the property would result in Payne having to pay significant capital gains taxes (her cost basis is close to zero) and no longer having sole ownership of the property. Therefore, a sale and leaseback transaction would not achieve Payne’s objectives.",

        "context": "William Azarov is a portfolio manager for Westcome Investments, an asset management\nfirm. Azarov is preparing for meetings with two of Westcome’s clients and\nobtains the help of Jason Boulder, a junior analyst. The first meeting is with Maglav\nInc., a rapidly growing US-based\ntechnology firm with a young workforce and high\nemployee turnover. Azarov directs Boulder to review the details of Maglav’s defined\nbenefit (DB) pension plan. The plan is overfunded and has assets under management\nof $25 million. Boulder makes the following two observations:\nObservation 1 Maglav’s shareholders benefit from the plan’s overfunded\nstatus.\nObservation 2 The funded ratio of Maglav’s plan will decrease if employee\nturnover decreases.\nMaglav outsources the management of the pension plan entirely to Westcome\nInvestments. The fee structure requires Maglav to compensate Westcome with a high\nbase fee regardless of performance. Boulder tells Azarov that outsourcing offers small\ninstitutional investors, such as Maglav’s pension plan, the following three benefits:\nBenefit 1: Regulatory requirements are reduced.\nBenefit 2: Conflicts of interest are eliminated from principal–agent issues.\nBenefit 3: Investors have access to a wider range of investment strategies\nthrough scale benefits.\nIn the meeting with Maglav, Azarov describes the investment approach used by\nWestcome in managing the pension plan. The approach is characterized by a high\nallocation to alternative investments, significant active management, and a reliance\non outsourcing assets to other external asset managers. Azarov also explains that\nMaglav’s operating results have a low correlation with pension asset returns and that\nthe investment strategy is affected by the fact that the pension fund assets are a small\nportion of Maglav’s market capitalization. Azarov states that the plan is subject to\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and follows generally\naccepted accounting principles, including Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n715, Compensation—Retirement Benefits.\nAzarov’s second meeting is with John Spintop, chief investment officer of the\nWolf University Endowment Fund (the Fund). Spintop hired Westcome to assist in\ndeveloping a new investment policy to present to the Fund’s board of directors. The\nFund, which has assets under management of $200 million, has an overall objective\nof maintaining long-term\npurchasing power while providing needed financial support\nto Wolf University. During the meeting, Spintop states that the Fund has an annual\nspending policy of paying out 4% of the Fund’s three-year\nrolling asset value to Wolf\nUniversity, and the Fund’s risk tolerance should consider the following three liability\ncharacteristics:\nCharacteristic 1 The Fund has easy access to debt markets.\nCharacteristic 2 The Fund supports 10% of Wolf University’s annual budget.\n\nCharacteristic 3 The Fund receives significant annual inflows from gifts and\ndonations.\nThe Fund has a small investment staff with limited experience in managing alternative\nassets and currently uses the Norway model for its investment approach. Azarov\nsuggests a change in investment approach by making an allocation to externally managed\nalternative assets—namely, hedge funds and private equity. Ten-year\nnominal\nexpected return assumptions for various asset classes, as well as three proposed allocations\nthat include some allocation to alternative assets, are presented in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nExpected inflation for the next 10 years is 2.5% annually.",

These stakeholders are interested in the sustainability of the pension plan, and the overfunded status is an asset on the balance sheet, potentially increasing the value of Maglav’s stock. The overfunded status also allows management to potentially lower employer contributions to the plan and increase net income. It also lowers financial risk, which may reduce volatility in the stock price. In addition, decreasing employee turnover will increase plan liabilities and worsen the funded ratio. With high turnover, fewer workers will be vested and entitled to defined benefit payments. Conversely, if employee turnover decreases, expected vesting will increase, leading to higher plan liabilities and a lower funded ratio.",

The endowment model operates in an asset-only context and is characterized by a high allocation to alternative investments, including private investments and hedge funds; significant active management; and outsourcing to external managers. These characteristics describe the investment approach used by Westcome. The skill in sourcing alternative investments is critically important given the large variation in performance among asset managers, especially for alternative investments.",

        "answers": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. The risk tolerance for Maglav’s defined benefit plan is high and thus above average. Several factors influence the plan sponsor’s ability to assume risk. For Maglav, the overfunded status of the pension fund allows the plan to withstand more volatility, and its small size relative to the company size implies greater risk tolerance. The low correlation of Maglav’s operating results with pension asset returns also results in greater risk tolerance. Finally, the workforce characteristics imply greater risk tolerance. The younger workforce increases the duration of the plan liabilities and enables the sponsor to take on more liquidity risk. The high turnover of the workforce means fewer employees may be vested, reducing the number of employees entitled to receive defined benefit payments. All these factors contribute to an above average risk tolerance for Maglav’s defined benefit plan.",

        "answers": "C",
        "explanation": "C is correct. Allocation 3 is the most appropriate allocation for the Fund. The annual expected returns for the three allocations are as follows: Allocation 1 exp. return = (0.45 × 4.1%) + (0.40 × 6.3%) + (0.10 × 7.5%) + (0.05 × 9.1%) = 5.57%. Allocation 2 exp. return = (0.10 × 4.1%) + (0.15 × 6.3%) + (0.15 × 7.5%) + (0.30 × 5.0%) + (0.30 × 9.1%) = 6.71%. Allocation 3 exp. return = (0.13 × 4.1%) + (0.32 × 6.3%) + (0.40 × 7.5%) + (0.05 × 5.0%) + (0.10 × 9.1%) = 6.71%. The real return for Allocation 1 is 3.07% (= 5.57% – 2.50%), and the real return for Allocation 2 and Allocation 3 is 4.21% (= 6.71% – 2.50%). Therefore, Allocation 1 is not appropriate because the expected real rate of return is less than the annual spending rate of 4%. With expected spending at 4%, the purchasing power of the Fund would be expected to decline over time with Allocation 1. Allocations 2 and 3 both offer an expected real rate of return greater than the annual spending rate of 4%. Thus, the purchasing power of the Fund would be expected to grow over time with either allocation. However, Allocation 3 is more appropriate than Allocation 2 because of its lower allocation to alternative assets (hedge funds and private equity). The total 60% allocation to alternative assets in Allocation 2 is well above the 15% allocation in Allocation 3 and is likely too high considering the Fund’s small investment staff and its limited experience with managing alternative investments. Also, given the Fund’s relatively small size of assets under management ($200 million), access to top hedge funds and private equity managers is likely to be limited.",

        "context": "Robert Harding is a portfolio manager at ValleyRise, a hedge fund based in the United\nStates. Harding monitors the portfolio alongside Andrea Yellow, a junior analyst.\nValleyRise only invests in equities, but Harding is considering other asset classes to\nadd to the portfolio, namely derivatives, fixed income, and currencies. Harding and\nYellow meet to discuss their trading strategies and price benchmarks.\nHarding begins the meeting by asking Yellow about factors that affect the selection\nof an appropriate trading strategy. Yellow tells Harding:\nStatement 1 Trading with greater urgency results in lower execution risk.\nStatement 2 Trading larger size orders with higher trade urgency reduces\nmarket impact.\nStatement 3 Securities with high rates of alpha decay require less aggressive\ntrading to realize alpha.\nAfter further discussion about Yellow’s statements, Harding provides Yellow a list\nof trades that he wants to execute. He asks Yellow to recommend a price benchmark.\nHarding wants to use a benchmark where the reference price for the benchmark is\ncomputed based on market prices that occur during the trading period, excluding\ntrade outliers.\nEarlier that day before the meeting, Yellow believed that the market had underreacted\nduring the pre- market trading session to a strong earnings announcement from\nABC Corp., a company that Yellow and Harding have been thoroughly researching for\nseveral months. Their research suggested the stock’s fair value was $90 per share, and\nthe strong earnings announcement reinforced their belief in their fair value estimate.\nRight after the earnings announcement, the pre- market price of ABC was $75.\nConcerned that the underreaction would be short- lived, Harding directed Yellow to\nbuy 30,000 shares of ABC stock. Yellow and Harding discussed a trading strategy,\nknowing that ABC shares are very liquid and the order would represent only about\n1% of the expected daily volume. They agreed on trading a portion of the order at the\nopening auction and then filling the remainder of the order after the opening auction.\nThe strategy for filling the remaining portion of the order was to execute trades at\nprices close to the market price at the time the order was received.\nHarding and Yellow then shift their conversation to XYZ Corp. Harding tells\nYellow that, after extensive research, he would like to utilize an algorithm to purchase\nsome shares that are relatively liquid. When building the portfolio’s position in XYZ,\nHarding’s priority is to minimize the trade’s market impact to avoid conveying information\nto market participants. Additionally, Harding does not expect adverse price\nmovements during the trade horizon.\nHarding and Yellow conclude their meeting by comparing trade implementation\nfor equities with the trade implementation for the new fixed- income, exchange- traded\nderivatives, and currency investments under consideration. Yellow tells Harding:\nReading 25 ■ Trade Strategy and Execution\n297\nStatement 4 Small currency trades and small exchange-traded\nderivatives\ntrades are typically implemented using the direct market access\n(DMA) approach.\nStatement 5 The high-touch\nagency approach is typically used to execute\nlarge, non-urgent\ntrades in fixed-income\nand exchange-traded\nderivatives markets.\nThe next day, Harding instructs Yellow to revisit their research on BYYP, Inc.\nYellow’s research leads her to believe that its shares are undervalued. She shares her\nresearch with Harding, and at 10 a.m. he instructs her to buy 120,000 shares when\nthe price is $40.00 using a limit order of $42.00.\nThe buy-side\ntrader releases the order for market execution when the price is\n$40.50. The only fee is a commission of $0.02 per share. By the end of the trading\nday, 90,000 shares of the order had been purchased, and BYYP closes at $42.50. The\ntrade was executed at an average price of $41.42. Details about the executed trades\nare presented in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\nWhile the buy-side\ntrader executes the BYYP trade, Harding and Yellow review\nValleyRise’s trade policy document. After reviewing the document, Yellow recommends\nseveral changes: 1) add a policy for the treatment of trade errors; 2) add a policy that\nensures over-the-\ncounter\nderivatives are traded on venues with rules that ensure\nminimum price transparency; and 3) alter the list of eligible brokers to include only\nthose that provide execution at the lowest possible trading cost.",

The\nbenchmark is a cap-weighted\nbond index with daily reported performance; the index\nis rebalanced frequently, making it difficult to replicate. The benchmark has a meaningful\ninvestment in foreign bonds, whereas Fund 3 invests only in domestic bonds.\nIn the final section of the report, Tolmach reviews the entire Plan’s characteristics,\nasset allocation, and benchmark.

A is incorrect because the benchmark is a cap-weighted bond index that is rebalanced frequently, making it difficult to replicate. For a benchmark to be investable, it must be possible to replicate and hold the benchmark to earn its return (at least gross of expenses). The sponsor should have the option of moving assets from active management to a passive benchmark. If the benchmark is not investable, it is not a viable investment alternative. Bond indexes are often not investable and are rebalanced frequently over time. C is incorrect because the index has a meaningful investment in foreign bonds, whereas Fund 3 invests only in domestic bonds, making the benchmark inappropriate. The benchmark must be consistent with the manager’s investment style or area of expertise.",

        "explanation": "C is correct. The 2016 fee calculation would not be affected by the high-water mark provision because it is the first year of operation of the fund and the return is positive (no prior losses to be offset). The investment management fee in 2016 is calculated as follows: Investment management fee = 1.00% + [20% × (8.0% − 1.00%)] = 2.4%. The 2017 fee calculation would also not be affected by the high-water mark provision because the profit sharing component of the fee is zero as a result of a negative return in that year. The investment management fee is calculated as follows: Investment management fee = 1.00% + 0.00% = 1.00%. The 2018 fee would be affected by the high-water mark provision because the sharing fee percentage would now be part of the 2018 gain and will need to offset the prior year losses, and only the remaining gains will generate a fee. The performance-based fee would be based on only the gains in excess of the high-water mark. The actual investment management fee charged (percentage and dollar value) will depend on the specific feature of the calculation, which is beyond the scope of this reading. Note that the correct answer can be identified by observing that 2018 is the only year in which a positive return follows a negative return in the prior year.",

Based on this analysis, 44.5% of\ninvestments are currently classified as liquid and 28.5% are classified as illiquid,\ncalculated as follows:\nInvestments classified as liquid = (Cash allocation × %Liquid) + (Fixed-income\nallocation × %Liquid) + (Public equity allocation × %Liquid)\nInvestments classified as liquid = (1% × 100%) + (24% × 100%) + (39% ×\n50%) = 44.5%.\nInvestments classified as illiquid = (Private equity allocation × %Illiquid) +\n(Real asset allocation × % Illiquid)\n\nThe liquid investment allocation of 44.5% is well above the 30% liquid requirement,\nand the 28.5% illiquid investment allocation is well below the 40% illiquid\nlimit.

        "answers": "Private equity is recognized as an illiquid alternative investment and may offer higher returns via a liquidity premium. The illiquidity premium (also called the liquidity premium) is the expected compensation for the additional risk of tying up capital for a potentially uncertain time period. It can be estimated, as Smith has done, by using the idea that the size of a discount an investor should receive for such capital commitment is represented by the value of a put option with an exercise price equal to the hypothetical “marketable price” of the illiquid asset as estimated at the time of purchase. Smith can derive the price of the illiquid private equity asset by subtracting the put price from the “marketable price.” If both the “marketable price” and the illiquid asset price are estimated or known, then the expected return for each can be calculated, with the difference in expected returns representing the illiquidity premium (in %).",

Kemney University’s spending policy is an example of a geometric smoothing rule, sometimes called the Yale formula. It is intended to bring about a predictable pattern of distributions for better planning of resource deployment through its programs across varying conditions, even as extreme as the 2008 global financial crisis. While this spending policy would be consistent with an investment objective of achieving long-term returns that support the spending rate while preserving the value of the endowment in real terms over time, the policy design also incorporates a smoothing, countercyclical element. This leads to lower spending rates in a period of sustained strong investment returns but higher spending rates in a protracted weak return environment.",

        "answers": "As a result of the allocation changes, there will be a reduction in the liquid and\nsemi-liquid\ncategories and an increase in the illiquid category under both normal\nand stress conditions. The proposed allocation shifting 5% of the endowment’s\ninvestments from liquid to illiquid assets would result in an increase in\nthe overall illiquidity profile.\nRegarding Brodka’s concern about the liquidity profile, Grides needs to ensure\nthat even under stress conditions the proposed allocation continues to comply\nwith the liquidity budgeting framework in place. From an ongoing management\nperspective—and particularly at times when the liquidity profile of the proposed\nallocation is closer to the minimum thresholds set through the liquidity\nbudget—Grides should plan to closely monitor the portfolio’s liquidity profile\nand stress test it periodically to make sure portfolio liquidity remains adequate.\nRegarding Brodka’s concern of risk profile “drift,” illiquid assets carry extremely\nhigh rebalancing costs. Because asset liquidity tends to decrease in periods of\nmarket stress, it is important to have sufficient liquid assets and rebalancing\nmechanisms in place to ensure the portfolio’s risk profile remains within acceptable\nrisk targets and does not “drift” as the relative valuations of different asset\nclasses fluctuate during stress periods. Since liquid assets will decrease due to\nthe proposed allocation, Grides must ensure an effective rebalancing mechanism\nis adopted prior to the investment and is consistently followed thereafter.\nThat mechanism can either be through a systematic discipline, such as calendar\nrebalancing or percent-range\nrebalancing that set pre-specified\ntolerance bands\nfor asset weights. Or, an automatic rebalancing method can be adopted, such as\nby using adjustments to a public market allocation that is correlated to a private\nmarket allocation (likely a more illiquid exposure) to rebalance private market\nrisk.\nContrary to its desired intent, and providing grounds for Brodka’s concerns,\nthis design would exacerbate the endowment’s liquidity needs in severe market\ndownturns. Given the possibility of such adverse events within Kemney’s long-term\nplanning horizon, the policy is very relevant as potentially introducing\nundesired risks.",

        "context": "Laura Davidson is a financial advisory partner with Emerald Private Bank (Emerald). Emerald is\nbased in Dublin, Ireland, and manages money on behalf of high-net-worth individual investors,\nfoundations, and endowments. Davidson works in Emerald's private wealth group (PWG). This\ngroup is tasked with meeting clients, developing financial plans, and implementing\nrecommendations from Emerald's investment committee. The PWG meets weekly to review new\nclient relationships and to discuss the most appropriate approach for working with each client.\nEmerald believes there are significant benefits to incorporating behavioral finance as part of their\nclient assessment process and has recently made changes to this effect. During preparation for\nthe weekly PWG meeting, Davidson reviews the financial holdings of three new clients along with\ntheir risk assessment questionnaires. Her observations are summarized in Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nDuring the meeting, fellow adviser Liam Roche makes the following observation based on\nthe information in Exhibit 1: \"Mr. Donnelly should respond favorably to education focused on\nhow the investment program affects financial security, retirement planning, and future\ngenerations. However, Ms. Connor and Mr. O'Driscoll will respond better to education on\nportfolio metrics, such as the Sharpe Ratio.\"\nAmanda Kelly is an investment strategist and a member of Emerald's investment committee.\nKelly sits in on the PWG meeting to provide an update on the firm's investment themes and\npositioning. Emerald has developed a multi-factor macro model to forecast such variables as GDP\ngrowth and interest rate movements. At the meeting, Kelly provides detailed information about the macro model, including many statistics on how the factors have performed using both\nin-sample and out-of-sample backtesting. The model appears to have had a good track record of\npredicting changes in the macro environment over time.\nAs part of her investment update, Kelly notes that the macro model predicts that interest\nrates in Europe are going to revert to their historical averages over the next three years and that\nthis move will start within the next six to nine months. Davidson asks Kelly if recent\nunprecedented monetary policy actions by the Bank of England and European Central Bank have\naffected the reliability of the model. Kelly responds that because the macro model incorporates\nmore than 100 different variables, central bank policies are accurately accounted for.\nLater that day, Kelly attends Emerald's weekly investment committee meeting. Kelly brings\nup Davidson's concerns regarding how central bank activity may affect the accuracy of their\nmacro model. Emerald's chief investment officer (CIO), who chairs the meeting, dismisses\nDavidson's concerns as uninformed. The rest of the committee members agree. The CIO then\nsuggests updating their stock selection model to incorporate a price momentum factor. Kelly\nstates that she is concerned that momentum will not be effective across all sectors. The CIO\ncounters that because several behavioral biases support the persistence of price momentum,\nthey would be foolish not to incorporate this factor. After a brief discussion, the other committee\nmembers agree with the CIO and momentum is added to the stock selection model.\nFollowing the meeting, Kelly is frustrated and writes an email to the CIO with suggestions\nshe believes will improve the dynamics of the investment committee in the future. Her\nrecommendations include the following:\n1. Spending more time analyzing prior committee decisions.\n2. Structuring the committee to ensure a higher level of common skills and experiences.\n3. Requesting stated opinions from members prior to any formal committee discussion.",

O’Reilly is meeting with the TTRS board to present his capital market expectations for the\nnext year.\nBoard member Arnold Brown asks O’Reilly about the use of high-frequency (daily) data in\ndeveloping capital market expectations. O’Reilly answers:\n“Sometimes it is necessary to use daily data to obtain a data series of the desired length.\nHigh-frequency data are more sensitive to asynchronism across variables and, as a result, tend to\nproduce higher correlation estimates.”\nBoard member Harold Melson noted he recently read an article on psychological traps\nrelated to making accurate and unbiased forecasts. He asks O’Reilly to inform the board about\nthe anchoring trap and the confirming evidence trap. O’Reilly offers the following explanation:\n“The anchoring trap is the tendency for forecasts to be overly influenced by the memory of\ncatastrophic or dramatic past events that are anchored in a person’s memory. The confirming\nevidence trap is the bias that leads individuals to give greater weight to information that supports\na preferred viewpoint than to evidence that contradicts it.”\nThe board asks O’Reilly about using a multifactor model to estimate asset returns and\ncovariances among asset returns. O’Reilly presented the factor covariance matrix for global\nequity and global bonds shown in Exhibit 1 and market factor sensitivities and residual risk shown\nin Exhibit 2.\n<image_1>\n<image_2>\n\nFinally, the board asks about forecasting expected returns for major markets given that price\nearnings ratios are not constant over time and that many companies are repurchasing shares\ninstead of increasing cash dividends. O’Reilly responds that the Grinold-Kroner model accounts\nfor those factors and then makes the following forecasts for the European equity market:\n• Dividend yield will be 1.95%\n• Shares outstanding will decline 1.00%\n• Long-term inflation rate will be 1.75% per year\n• An expansion rate for P/E multiples of 0.15% per year\n• Long-term corporate real earnings growth at 3.5% per year",

She has been asked to produce capital market expectations for asset\nclasses in several different markets relevant to the Diversified Absolute Return Strategies Fund\n(DARS), the company’s largest fund.\nNava is aware that long-term GDP trend forecasting is considered the starting point to form\ncapital market expectations at Globofunds, but she is unsure why this is the case. She asks a\ncolleague, Jedd Wiggins to explain why long-term trend GDP growth is considered so important\nwhen forecasting asset class returns. Wiggins makes the following two statements.\n• Statement 1: There is both theoretical and empirical support for the case that the average\nlevel of real government bond yields is causally linked to the trend rate of growth in the\neconomy.\n• Statement 2: Over the long run, the total return of an equity market is causally linked to the\ngrowth rate of GDP.\nTo make a forecast of trend GDP growth in the domestic economy, Nava collates the\nfollowing Globofunds data displayed in Figure 1. \n<image_1>\nNava has the view that increased levels of globalization will lead to the current account\nplaying a larger role in growth rate of economies. She considers the macroeconomic linkages\nbetween the three main economies which the fund is exposed to. Macroeconomic data relating\nto these economies is displayed in Figure 2.\n<image_2>\nNava also considers the movement in foreign exchange to be a key determinant of the\nmedium-term performance of DARS. She considers the macroeconomic policy of the three main\ndeveloping markets which the fund is exposed to and collates the data as shown in Figure 3.\n<image_3>\nNava attempts to forecast the likely foreign exchange rate movements that will affect the\nfund. She notes that the largest foreign currency exposure is in Country X. The current spot rate\nof the domestic currency of the fund (DOM) versus the foreign currency of Country X (FOR) is\nDOM/FOR = 1.3020. Data related to the expected returns in the domestic and foreign markets is\ndisplayed below in Figure 4.\n<image_4>\nNava also considers purchasing power parity as a tool for long-term foreign exchange rate\nforecasting. She notes that expected inflation in the domestic country is higher than the expected\ninflation in Country X.",

There is theoretical and empirical evidence that average long-term\ngovernment bond yields are directly linked to the trend rate of growth in an economy.\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Over the long run, the capital gains component of equity returns is\ndirectly linked to GDP. However, this does not apply to the income component of returns (i.e., the\ndividend yield).

This is equal to 0.75% + 0.00% + 1.10% + 3.00% + 0.00% = 4.85%.\nThe expected return of the market in Country X is given by the sum of the Country X returns and\npremiums.

(WWM).\nWWM’s clients include pension funds, foundations, sovereign funds, high-net-worth individuals,\nand family trusts. Fox is in the process of hiring an asset allocation analyst and has just completed\ninterviewing two candidates, Ambrose Kelly and Catherine Trainor, for the position. The\ninterviews were directed around the case study of Jane Lennon, a fictitious client, described in\nExhibit 1. \n<image_1>\nFox reviews her interview notes.\nFox told the candidates to assume that Lennon would use sub-portfolios to achieve her\naspirational goals and asked them to identify which of the sub-portfolios is in the best position to\ntolerate the greatest risk exposure.\nIn reviewing Lennon’s risk tolerance, Fox pointed out that Lennon’s prior investment\nexperience clearly indicates some behavioral biases that would influence her reaction to any\nasset allocation proposals.\nFox reminded the candidates that in addition to high-net-worth individuals, the firm’s client\nbase also includes various institutional investors. The candidates made the following statements:\nTrainor: A goals-based approach to asset allocation is appropriate for individual investors, but\ninstitutions need to focus either on the asset or liability side of the balance sheet, depending on\nthe nature of their business.\nKelly: A typical objective of some institutions is to maximize their Sharpe ratio for an acceptable\nlevel of volatility, and they rely on the law of large numbers to assist them in modeling their\nliabilities. Other institutions behave much like individuals by segmenting general account assets\ninto sub-portfolios associated with specific lines of business with their individual return\nobjectives.\nFox mentioned to the candidates that when dealing with strategic asset allocation, investors\noften had difficulty understanding the relevant characteristics of asset classes. They responded:\nKelly: I like to stress to clients that asset classes should have high within-group correlations but\nlow correlations with other classes. In addition, because investors need to rebalance to a\nstrategic asset allocation, asset classes need to have both sufficient liquidity and low transaction\ncosts.\nTrainor: It is important that asset classes should be diversifying. I always look for low pairwise\ncorrelations with other asset classes.\nOther general comments were noted about asset classes, but Fox could not recall their\nsources:\n• Emerging market equities should not be considered a separate asset class from global\nequities.\n• Asset classes differ from strategies in offering a non-skill-based ex ante expected return\npremium.\n• Asset classes should be defined in such a way that there is no overlap in sources of risk.",

Her agenda is to discuss concerns\nregarding low oil prices and how that affects the country's wealth in its concentrated position in\noil, a proposed change to the fund's strategic asset allocation to increase the overall return of\nthe fund in response to the low price of oil, and divestiture of some real estate assets to capture\ngains. Rashwan first presents the current and proposed asset allocations shown below.\n<image_1>\nShe explains to the board of directors that since the fund has low liquidity needs the\nproposed strategic asset allocation will allow the skilled submanagers to add value through\nactive management of the non-traditional assets.\nIn 2008, many of the fund's foreign investments that were purchased at the peak of the real\nestate market lost substantial amounts of value. Some of those real estate values have since\nrebounded and are currently above the purchase price. Rashwan proposes to sell the fund's USD\n100 million stake in a hotel located in the United States in South Beach Miami. Zein Minkara,\npresident of a major pharmaceutical company, states, \"We should sell now to lock in the gains,\navoiding the substantial and painfullosses that many of our real estate holdings experienced\nduring the last global recession.\" The hotel property value has a pre-tax standard deviation of 13%\nand would be subject to a 20% capital gains tax.\nRegarding the low price of oil, Jamal Zayat, Sultan of Azurbikan, states, \"Since we're part of\nOPEC, a consortium of oil exporting nations, we should agree to restrict the world supply of oil, thus propping up its price as we've been able to do in the past.\" Siham Atallah, chairman of the\ncentral bank of Azurbikan, discusses changes in the economic environment of oil production\nputting downward pressure on oil prices. These changes include reduced demand in gasoline\nthrough greater fuel-efficient cars, weak economies of Europe and developing countries, and the\ndevelopment of new technologies allowing countries to extract oil and natural gas from areas\nthat were once unprofitable.\nAtallah ends with a summary of short-term capital market expectations:\n• “Overall global GDP is expected to grow at a moderate pace,\n• the yield curve is expected to flatten with shor-term rates increasing while long-term rates\nremain steady,\n• yield spreads are exceedingly high, and\n• global real estate values are showing signs of overvaluation in some markets.\"",

Channel is financially strong, and the industry\noutlook is stable. Channel’s profitability is high, primarily driven by robust underwriting results\nand favorable investment returns on its large reserve of assets.\nChannel’s investment group is focused on matching premium reserve assets to projected\npolicyholder claims, investing excess assets for growth. The reserve currently has sufficient\nsurplus to support its liabilities. Regulators impose a maximum limit of 10% of total reserve\nassets (which include matched and excess assets) on non-publicly traded securities. Mukasa’s\nnew assistant, Samiah Pai, presents three possible allocation options for total reserve assets, as\nshown in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nMukasa also serves as a trustee of Channel’s defined-benefit pension plan. The plan is\nlegally distinct from Channel’s assets. The company has made contributions sufficient to\nmaintain a fully funded status. It is a tax-exempt fund and must hold 20% of its assets in\ndomestic government bonds to maintain its tax-exempt status. The plan’s key objective is to\nmeet current and future pension obligations. The plan’s current allocation is 60% global equities,\n20% domestic government bonds, 15% domestic corporate bonds, and 5% cash.\nMukasa is considering adding a new asset class to Channel’s pension fund to improve\nexpected returns. Pai compiles data for three possible new asset classes (Exhibit 2).\n<image_2>\nSeveral years later, Channel’s pension plan has grown to over EUR 5 billion in assets. During\nthat time, the fund’s allocation to illiquid assets (which includes direct real estate, private equity\nand infrastructure) increased to 30%.\nChannel maintains its leading position in the insurance industry and its balance sheet\nremains healthy. However, given heightened competition and increasingly soft pricing\nconditions,\nChannel staff members are researching possible cost saving strategies for management\nconsideration. While viewed as an unlikely choice by Mukasa, reducing Channel’s cash\ncontributions to its pension plan is among them. The plan is currently 90% funded.\nPai reviews key benefits and constraints of large institutional investors in asset allocation\nthat may be relevant to Channel’s pension plan. He makes the following statements.\nStatement 1: A substantial allocation to illiquid assets may be inappropriate for Channel’s\npension plan if there is a significant probability of Channel lowering its\ncontributions to the plan.\nStatement 2: Large institutional investors, such as Channel’s pension plan, will likely benefit\nfrom deploying active equity strategies, due to manager access, liquidity, and\ntrading cost advantages.\nStatement 3: Channel’s pension fund may rebalance portfolio weights from the strategic\nallocation to exploit perceived opportunities based on its latest five-year capital\nmarket expectations.",

        "explanation": "Solution: A. Global real estate is most likely to be considered for inclusion by Channel’s pension plan for any of the following reasons:\n• Asset classes should be mutually exclusive for the purpose of asset allocation. Overlapping asset classes will reduce the effectiveness of asset allocation in controlling risk. Thus, given the plan’s current investment in global equities, emerging markets equities should be excluded from consideration. In addition, we assume that the plan’s current allocation to domestic corporate bonds includes both investment grade and high yields. While the high yield allocation is not explicitly defined, global high-yield corporate bonds are likely to overlap somewhat and should be excluded from consideration.\n• Asset classes should be diversifying. A new asset class should not have extremely high expected correlations (over 0.95) with existing asset classes. Otherwise, the new asset class will be effectively redundant in a portfolio because it will duplicate risk exposures already present. None of the possible asset classes presented in the example have high expected correlations with the current portfolio.\n• The asset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of world investable wealth. Selecting an asset allocation from a group of asset classes satisfying this criterion should increase expected return for a given level of risk (Sharpe ratio).\nBased on global real estate’s Sharpe ratio (relatively high) and its correlation to the existing portfolio (reasonably low), while the existing portfolio’s Sharpe ratio is not provided, we can make a reasonable assumption that adding this asset class will likely improve the portfolio’s expected return.\nNote that global real estate is the only asset class left after the two other asset classes were eliminated based on mutual exclusivity.\nOther remaining criteria to help specify asset classes include: Assets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous. Asset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a meaningful proportion of an investor’s portfolio without seriously affecting the portfolio’s liquidity.",

        "explanation": "Solution: A. The change to the expected cash contributions to the pension fund, if adopted, would materially affect the fund’s asset allocation strategy. The odds of that happening, however, appear low at present according to Mukasa. At this point, this indicates a need for the pension plan to increase sensitivity to liquidity concerns but is not necessarily cause for immediate revisions to the current allocation.\nLarge institutional investors, including Channel’s pension plan, may benefit from operational efficiencies and other competitive advantages (such as scale, expertise and resources). However, scale may also impose obstacles related to the liquidity conditions and trading costs of the underlying assets. A very large size might make it difficult to deploy capital effectively in certain active equity strategies—for example, to benefit from opportunistic investments in niche markets or from skilled investment managers who have a small set of unique ideas or concentrated bets. Therefore, Statement 2 is not necessarily correct.\nStatement 3 is mixing portfolio rebalancing (to a strategic asset allocation) and tactical asset allocation (relative to strategic asset allocation). Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation.\nChanges in asset prices may cause the portfolio asset mix to deviate from strategic target weights even in the absence of changing investor circumstances, a revised economic outlook, or tactical asset allocation views. In contrast, tactical asset allocation (TAA) involves short-term tilts away from the strategic asset allocation (SAA) in order to exploit perceived opportunities in financial market conditions (e.g., temporary asset mispricing).These short-term bets are expected to increase risk-adjusted return. SAA is developed based on long-term economic forecasts and capital market expectations (long-term expected asset class returns).",

The firm manages\nhigh-net-worth private client investment portfolios using various asset allocation strategies.\nAnalyst Hannah Montgomery assists Remington.\nRemington and Montgomery’s first meeting of the day are with a new client, Spencer\nShipman, who recently won $900,000 in the lottery. Shipman wants to fund a comfortable\nretirement. Earning a return on his investment portfolio that outpaces inflation over the long\nterm is critical to him. He plans to withdraw $54,000 from the lottery winnings investment\nportfolio in one year to help fund the purchase of a vacation home and states that it is important\nthat he be able to withdraw the $54,000 without reducing the initial $900,000 principal.\nMontgomery suggests they use a risk-adjusted expected return approach in selecting one of the\nportfolios provided in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nRemington and Montgomery discuss the importance of strategic asset allocation with\nShipman. Remington states that the firm’s practice is to establish targeted asset allocations and a\ncorridor around the target. Movements of the asset allocations outside the corridor trigger a\nrebalancing of the portfolio. Remington explains that for a given asset class, the higher the\ntransaction costs and the higher the correlation with the rest of the portfolio, the wider the\nrebalancing corridor. Montgomery adds that the higher the volatility of the rest of the portfolio,\nexcluding the asset class being considered, the wider the corridor.\nRemington and Montgomery next meet with client Katherine Winfield. The firm had\nestablished Winfield’s current asset allocation on the basis of reverse optimization using the\ninvestable global market portfolio weights with further adjustments to reflect Winfield’s views\non expected returns.\nRemington and Montgomery discuss with Winfield some alternative asset allocation models\nthat she may wish to consider, including resampled mean–variance optimization (resampling).\nRemington explains that resampling combines mean–variance optimization (MVO) with Monte\nCarlo simulation, leading to more diversified asset allocations. Montgomery comments that\nresampling, like other asset allocation models, is subject to criticisms, including that risker asset\nallocations tend to be under-diversified and the asset allocations inherit the estimation errors in\nthe original inputs. Montgomery inquires whether asset allocation models based on heuristics or other techniques might be of interest to Winfield and makes the following comments:\n1. The 60/40 stock/bond heuristic optimizes the growth benefits of equity and the risk reduction benefits of bonds.\n2. The Norway model is a variation of the endowment model that actively invests in publicly traded securities while giving consideration to environmental, social, and governance issues.\n3. The 1/N heuristic allocates assets equally across asset classes with regular rebalancing without regard to return, volatility, or correlation.",

VU just successfully completed a\nfundraising campaign of $300 million that significantly increased the funds in the endowment\n(Exhibit 1).\n<image_1>\nAt a meeting with VU’s board of regents, Brealer proposes that the endowment should fund\na new capital improvements project for the university that will cost $210.3 million. Brealer\nacknowledges that it is a large amount that will require another fundraising campaign in the\nfuture, but he states that he has already found a wealthy alumnus, Roger Clement, who is willing\nto donate $50 million if the project is undertaken.\nJennifer Wong, a board member, asks: “If we undertake the project with Clement’s\ndonation but without a new fundraising campaign, how much will the endowment be\nunderfunded?” Other board members agree that the answer to this question should be\nconsidered before making a decision. Consequently, the board decides to discuss Brealer’s\nproposal further at a future meeting.\nThe board moves on to a discussion about the investment of the endowment with the\nrecently raised funds. Ronald Black, an investment adviser to the board, suggests the following:\n· The asset allocation choice should have a heavy emphasis on fixed-income securities\nwith cash distributions. This type of allocation will offset the future cash disbursements\nnecessary to cover costs at the university in excess of tuition revenue.\n· The weightings within the portfolio should be able to deviate within 5% of the target\nportfolio weights to take advantage of short-term market opportunities for additional\nreturn.\nBrealer suggests bringing Black’s portfolio allocation ideas to the University Planning and\nPriorities Committee (UPPC). The UPPC is composed of six tenured faculty members and three\nfinal-year students. Three of the faculty members are from the arts area, and three are from the\nsciences area. Faculty appointments to the committee are for two-year, non-renewable terms.\nBrealer states that the UPPC desires to have the endowment invested in a socially\nresponsible manner, which will require developing a new investment policy statement (IPS). The UPPC intends to draft the new IPS and present it to the board for approval. Upon receiving board\napproval, the UPPC will direct a financial advisory team and the investment managers to\nimplement the asset allocation indicated in the IPS. Progress reports and governance audits will\nbe provided to the board upon request.\nThe board is agreeable to this plan and assigns Black to be part of the advisory team after\nthe IPS is drafted and approved.\nBlack states that the UPPC should also consider such issues as the cost associated with\nrebalancing the portfolio and that the future distribution of asset returns may not be fully\ncharacterized by the expected return and volatility. Black further states that his preferred\nmethod for dealing with these additional allocation issues is the use of Monte Carlo simulation.",

        "context": "Olivinia is an oil-rich state in the country of Puerto Rinaldo, which uses the US dollar as its official\ncurrency of exchange. In 1981, the state’s legislature created the Olivinia Heritage Fund (OHF) to\ncollect a portion of the state’s non-renewable resource revenue and invest it on behalf of future\ngenerations. James Lafferty, the managing director of the fund, is one of the keynote speakers at\nthe Global Wealth Creation Conference. He begins his presentation with a brief overview of\nOHF’s history (Exhibit 1).\n<image_1>\nExhibit 1 An overview of the olivinia heritage fund\nPhase 1 (1981–1991)\n• The fund was given an initial allocation of $1 billion by the state. The fund was to receive 10%\nof all state revenues arising from taxes on oil and gas production and extraction. The fund\nwas given a 20-year accumulation period over which no distributions were allowed and the\nfund was forecasted to grow to $10 billion. Income earned following the accumulation\nperiod was to be used to provide for public works and other public infrastructure within the\nstate. Investments were restricted to cash and investment-grade bonds.\nPhase 2 (1991–2001)\n• By 1991, after being in existence for 10 years, the fund value had grown to $2.2 billion. At\nthis time, transfers of state revenues from taxes on oil-related resources was halted and the\ngovernment began to use income generated by the fund for direct economic development\nand social investment purposes. In addition to cash and investment-grade bonds, the\ninvestment mandate for the fund was expanded to include investments in private and\npublic companies, real estate, and infrastructure investments. Management of cash and\nbond investments was performed in-house. For the higher-risk component of the portfolio,\nthe fund hired external managers in an effort to increase return and correspondingly lower\nthe incidence of negative performance. These managers were hired or retained if they had\noutperformed other active managers in their sectors in at least the prior two years. The\nfund value at the end of this period was $6 billion.\nPhase 3 (2001–2014)\n• Strong reform legislation related to the original intent of the fund was introduced in 2001. It\nreinstated transfers of oil-related taxes to the fund, increasing them to 35% of oil- and\ngas-related state revenues. In addition, the fund was mandated to have 50% in public\nequities through passive index funds and 10% in cash and investment-grade bonds. The\nremainder was to be divided equally between high-yield bonds, real estate, private equity,\nand hedge funds and would continue to be managed externally. All investments were to be\nmade outside the country to avoid overheating the national economy. Investments\nmanaged by individual external managers was limited to approximately $75 million. A two-thirds majority in both the upper and lower legislative bodies was required to change\nany future legislation related to the fund. By the end of this phase, the fund was worth $28\nbillion.\nPhase 4 (2014–Present)\n• The fund’s management felt that the significant decline in oil prices since mid-2014 and\nlowered production levels were likely to persist through several business cycles, requiring a\nchange in strategy to maintain the long-term objectives of the funds. They sought\ngovernment approval for lower withdrawals from the fund, higher equity exposure, and the\nflexibility to vary asset class policy weights by as much ±5% for each asset class from the\nstatic weights that had previously existed. The government reaffirmed its commitment to\nthe fund given in Phase 3, and legislative approval was received for these changes, including\nthe ability to increase public equity exposure to 65% and reduce investment-grade bond\nexposure to as little as 7.5%. Of the remaining authorized assets, no one asset class could\nhave a weight in excess of 10%.\nLafferty states that ever since the fund was given the authority to vary asset class policy\nweights from their strategic levels, it has actively engaged in tactical asset allocation (TAA) using\na variety of proprietary short-term forecasting tools that have been developed in-house. He\nprovides the data in Exhibits 2 and 3 to illustrate the results of one such shift in the fund’s asset\nallocation following a signal from its TAA model.\n<image_2>\n<image_3>\nLafferty concludes the morning portion of his presentation at the conference by comparing\nthe relative performance of the three portfolios (from Exhibit 2) utilizing a graph (Exhibit 3) of\nthe efficient frontier derived from the asset classes used by the fund.",

        "context": "Joenia Dantas is a financial risk manager for Alimentos Serra (AS), a Brazilian manufacturer and\nexporter of soybean-based food products. AS is a privately held corporation, wholly owned by\nCesar Serra. Recently, AS took out a R25,000,000, four-year, floating-rate bank loan requiring\nsemi-annual payments of interest based on SELIC (Banco Central do Brasil’s overnight lending rate)\nplus a spread of 4.50 percent and repayment of principal at maturity. Serra believes that interest\nrates will rise in the near future and worries that AS will be unable to absorb the higher loan\ncosts associated with an increase in rates. Dantas tells him that she will convert the loan to a\n10.80 percent fixed rate by entering into the pay-fixed side of a four-year, R25,000,000 notional\nprincipal interest rate swap with semi-annual payments that exchanges SELIC for a fixed rate of\n10.80 percent. She explains that the swap will act as a hedge for the loan, reducing the\ncompany’s net cash flow risk and net market value risk.\nDiscussions with Dantas about using interest rate swaps to reduce risk cause Serra to think\nabout the fixed income portion of his personal investment portfolio, which includes R12.0 million\nin bonds that have a modified duration of 5.50 years. Serra’s beliefs about rising interest rates\nmake him want to reduce the bond portfolio’s modified duration to 2.00 years using interest rate\nswaps. In order to determine the correct swap position, he needs to learn how to calculate the\nmodified duration of a swap. He asks Dantas how to do this. She explains it to him, using the\nexample described in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nSerra decides to use a swap that has a modified duration of -2.40 years for the pay-fixed side\nto reduce his bond portfolio’s duration to the desired level.\nDantas knows that AS currently needs to borrow an additional R30,000,000 for 5 years to\nfund its growth. Brazilian credit markets have tightened and it would cost 17.70 percent per year\nto borrow this amount locally, but AS can obtain a yen-denominated loan at a fixed rate of 9.50\npercent. This would expose it to substantial currency risk. A 5-year currency swap is available in\nwhich AS would pay interest in real to the counterparty at 12.20 percent and receive interest in\nyen from the counterparty at 7.10 percent. The current exchange rate is ¥40/R.\nIn addition to the current needs, in six months AS will enter into a four-year, quarterly\npayment, R50,000,000 loan to fund local projects. Dantas expects to borrow these funds at a\nfloating rate and convert the loan to fixed using an interest rate swap. She explains to Serra that AS can commit to a fixed rate of 14.3 percent for the future loan by buying a payer swaption\ntoday with an exercise rate of 14.3 percent for a four-year swap with quarterly payments and a\nnotional principal amount of R50,000,000.",

Using an\ninterest rate swap to convert the loan from a floating rate to a fixed rate reduces the cash flow\nrisk.

Over the past 20 years, the firm has primarily invested in U.S.\nsecurities with small allocations to high quality long-term foreign government bonds. Garrison’s\nlargest account, Point University, has a market value of $800 million and an asset allocation as\ndetailed in Figure 1. \n<image_1>\nGarrison recently convinced the board of trustees at Point University that the endowment\nshould allocate a portion of the portfolio to European equities. The board has agreed to the plan\nbut wants the allocation to international equities to be a short-term tactical move. Managers at\nGarrison have put together the following proposal for the reallocation:\nTo minimize trading costs while gaining exposure to international equities, the\nportfolio can use futures contracts on the domestic 12-month mid-cap equity index and\non the 12-month European equity index. This strategy will temporarily exchange $80\nmillion of U.S. mid-cap exposure for European equity index exposure. Relevant data on\nthe futures contracts are provided in Figure 2.\n<image_2>\nThree months after proposing the international diversification plan, Garrison was able to\npersuade Point University to make a direct short-term investment in Haikuza International (HI), a\nJapanese electronics firm. Analysts at Garrison have regressed the historical returns of the HI\nstock with changes in value of the yen. When the HI returns are measured in U.S. dollars, the\nregression slope coefficient is +0.80.\nThe managers at Garrison are discussing other factors that may be considered if they\ncontinue to diversify into foreign markets. The following statements are made:\nStatement 1: The minimum variance hedge ratio is riskier than a simple direct one-for-one\nhedge ratio because it depends on the correlation between asset and currency returns.\n• Statement 2: An alternative to selling the yen forward to implement the HI currency hedge\nwould be to buy calls on the USD. This would protect the portfolio from currency risk while\nstill retaining potential currency upside. Unfortunately, it will have a higher initial cost.",

In this case, it was\nspecified to use three-year duration instruments, so borrow at 1% U.S. rates and invest at 2% U.K.\nrates. An increase in U.K. rates would hurt the value of the bonds purchased and having\nborrowed in the United States at 3-year duration, the decline in U.S. rates increases the value of\nthat liability, which is also a loss to the investor. The carry trade will not work if IRP predicts\nchanges in currency value. The United Kingdom has the higher interest rate, so its currency will\ntrade at a forward discount. If the U.K. currency (GBP) declines it will take more GBP to buy the\nUSD required to pay back the U.S. borrowing. The cross currency carry trade actually depends in\npart on the observation that the higher interest rate (GBP) currency usually appreciates in value,\nForward premiums and discounts are not valid predictors of change in currency value.",

An alternative is to sell another currency that is highly correlated to the NOK, a\nform of cross hedge (sometimes called a proxy hedge). The idea is that if the NOK declines versus\nthe USD, the SEK will also decline for a gain on the short SEK contracts that offsets the loss on\nNOK. There must be high correlation and a predictable relationship of the SEK and NOK for this to\nwork. Higher correlation to the USD has nothing to do directly with the cross hedge of the\ncurrency risk. Note that if the USD and the other currencies are highly correlated, it suggests they\nchange in similar fashion to each other; in other words, the exchange rate will be relatively stable\nand change in currency value will be a less significant factor in the return earned from investing\nin the foreign bond.",

        "context": "Samuel Morse, is a senior analyst in the Balance Sheet Strategy Division of Bayside\nInsurance. Morse has been asked to contrast the merits of cash flow matching and duration\nmatching. Bayside presently uses both strategies, but given the recent increase in volatility in US\ninterest rates over the last month, Bayside’s management wants to better prepare for future\nopportunities.\nMorse also considers the use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk. This would be a new\nstrategy for Bayside. Morse determines the number of bond futures needed to immunize the\noverall interest rate risk exposure of the company. The basis point value (BPV) for the asset\nportfolio is 48,000, while the liability portfolio has a BPV of 22,000. To facilitate her analysis,\nMorse compiles the additional information related to bond futures shown in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nMorse intends to construct sample portfolio structures by shifting the allocations between\nthree tenors of bullet government bonds: 2-year, 10-year and 30-year US Treasury securities. The\nallocations in the sample portfolios are shown in Exhibit 2. The expected return estimates for the\n2- and 30-year bonds, which are shown in Exhibit 3.\n<image_2>\n<image_3>\nMorse interviews Horace Mann to assist him in evaluating fixed-income funds and securities\nfor the bank’s fixed-income offerings.

Mann asks Morse why he chose only overvalued bonds with capital\ngains and did not include any bonds with capital losses.

Armstrong anticipates that the client will\nask about differences between investing in emerging markets credits and developed markets\ncredits. To address this potential inquiry, Armstrong plans to emphasize the following differences.\nDifference 1: Commodity producers and banks represent a higher proportion of emerging\nmarkets indexes than of developed market indexes.\nDifference 2: Total or partial government ownership of emerging markets issuers is\ncommon, which results in a higher average recovery rate for defaulted\nsenior unsecured bonds for emerging markets than for developed markets.\nDifference 3: Compared with developed markets, the credit quality of emerging markets\nissuers tends to be more concentrated at the very high and very low\nportions of the credit spectrum.\nArmstrong also is preparing a more general discussion about domestic versus international\nportfolio management. The written report by Armstrong identifies three statements that he\nwould like to check for accuracy.\nStatement 1 Currency risk in global credit portfolios can be mitigated by using currency swaps or\nby investing in credits denominated in currencies that are pegged or tightly managed by the\ngovernment.\nStatement 2 Liquidity concerns for emerging markets credits are mitigated by their frequency of\ntrading and modest legal risk.\nStatement 3 Sectors tend to perform similarly across regions.",

The significant sector deviations despite this high diversification are often indicative of a multi-factor manager. The relatively low tracking error further supports the\nargument that Essos is a multi-factor manager. The tracking error constraint of less than 5% and\nsector deviations of ≤ 8% are relative constraint functions. The limit on single security to be not\nmore than 2% is an absolute—not a relative—constraint. It does not depend on benchmark\nweights. A is incorrect because the fund follows a fully quantitative implementation approach\n(allocations are unaffected by a portfolio manager’s judgment); hence it is systematic. C is\nincorrect because the fund allows significant deviations from the sector relative to the sector\ndeviations sought by a closet indexer",

She believes that the portfolios of a number\nof her clients would benefit from investments in hedge funds. Maximoff has discussed the\nrelative merits of hedge fund investing with six clients and has received their approval to add this\nasset class to their portfolios, subject to agreed upon investment criteria. Maximoff consults the\nnotes that she has made during her conversations with these clients.\nClient 1 prefers a hedge fund strategy that uses top-down analysis in a broad range of\nsecurities markets, taking positions that are thematic or directional. Markets can be valued using\nmacroeconomic and fundamental analysis, and the hedge fund strategy is typically implemented\nusing discretionary trading. Maximoff also notes that this client has a high tolerance for\ninvestment risk.\nClient 2 has given Maximoff a mandate to invest in event-driven strategies only. Maximoff’s\nnotes on event-driven strategies include the following statements.\nStatement 1: Distressed security investing generally uses high levels of leverage.\nStatement 2: A merger arbitrage strategy is analogous to writing insurance on the\nacquisition.\nStatement 3: A hard-catalyst event-driven strategy tends to be riskier and more volatile\nthan a soft-catalyst strategy.\nClient 3 has expressed a preference for multi-strategy funds instead of fund-of-funds for the\nfollowing reasons:\nReason 1: Multi-strategy funds can reallocate funds into different strategy areas more\nquickly and easily compared to a fund-of-funds.\nReason 2: The fee structure of multi-strategy funds is often more attractive than that of a\nfund-of-funds.\nClient 4 wants to add a volatility trading strategy as a portfolio diversifier and has specified\nthat the strategy must by highly liquid. Maximoff’s notes indicate that there are multiple ways of\nimplementing a volatility trading strategy; although, some strategies offer more liquidity than\nothers.\nClient 5 decides to invest in an equity hedge fund strategy and substantial amount of\nleverage is allowed. Due to a recent large increase in interest rates and geopolitical tensions,\nMaximoff’s forecast about equity market has changed from one of modestly rising equities to\nseveral periods of non-trending markets.\nClient 6 is a small foundation that has a traditional asset allocation of 65% stocks/35% bonds.\nIt considers allocating 10% of portfolio asset to hedge fund strategy. The foundation requires the hedge fund strategy allocation to: a) limit volatility, b) maximize risk-adjusted returns, and c) limit\ndownside risk.\nWanda prepares expected risk and return characteristics for three portfolios that have\nallocations of 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% hedge funds, where the 10% hedge fund\nallocation follows either an equity market-neutral, global macro, or convertible arbitrage strategy.\nThe risk and return characteristics of the three portfolios are presented in Panel B of Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>",

        "explanation": "The most appropriate equity-related hedge fund strategy for Client 5 is an equity market-neutral\n(EMN) equity strategy. Overall, EMN managers are more useful for portfolio allocation during\nperiods of non-trending or declining markets. EMN managers neutralize market risk by\nconstructing their portfolios such that the expected portfolio beta is approximately equal to zero.\nSince these portfolios do not take beta risk and attempt to neutralize many other factor risks,\nthey typically must apply leverage to the long and short positions to achieve a meaningful return\nprofile from their individual stock selections.\nDespite the use of substantial leverage, EMN strategies typically deliver return profiles that are\nsteadier and less volatile than those of many other hedge strategy areas",

One of OI’s clients HYDU is\na private university with an endowment valued at USD 1.5 billion invested primarily in traditional\nassets. During the investment committee’s annual meeting, the chief investment officer (CIO) of\nthe endowment , Erik Lensherr suggests changing allocations in alternatives, specifically in hedge\nfunds and private equity. The investment committee (IC) asks Robert Reynold, a senior portfolio\nmanager at OI, to evaluate Lensherr’s suggestion. During their meeting, Reynold explains the risk\nfactor-based asset allocation framework, and currently the endowment still follows the\ntraditional approach to asset allocation. Reynold makes the following comments about the\nbenefits and limitations of the risk-based approach.\n“The risk-based approach helps in identifying common risk factors across all investments,\nwhether public or private, passive or active. Investors can have an integrated risk management\nframework, which can quantify risk effectively. This approach also faces certain limitations. The\nrisk-factor estimation may be sensitive to the historical sample, and it can sometimes lead to the\noverestimation of portfolio diversification.”\nLensherr shows Reynold the endowment’s current asset given in Exhibit 1. \n<image_1>\nThe\nendowment’s spending rate is 4% calculated as a percentage of the endowment’s trailing 5-year\naverage value. The IC assumes capital calls for private investments over the coming year to be\nabout 20% of the current private asset net asset value. Lensherr adds that the IC would like an\nexpected return of 8% and accept volatility of 15%. Reynold discovers that the IC is willing to\ntolerate a 1-year 99% CVaR of -20%.\nReynold presents the following expected returns prepared by OI’s analysts to Lensherr based\non a stress scenario of the capital market for the next 12 months. OI predicts inflation to be at\nexpectations levels, short rates to be slightly up, bonds yield to be stable, and equities to be trending upwards.\n<image_2>\nAnother client of OI is Atlantis Insurance. Reynold is discussing with Scott Lang, CFO of\nAtlantis Insurance, how to diversify the insurance company’s portfolio. Lang is interested in\ninvesting in different hedge fund strategies. In selecting a hedge fund manager, Lang prefers to\nhire a manager that uses the following:\nTake advantage of arbitrage opportunities between securities that arise because of\nvariations in duration, credit quality, liquidity, and optionality.\nTo exploit price differences relative to expected future price relationships, with mean\nreversion being an important consideration.\nTo forecast macroeconomic conditions to enable trades across various points on the yield\ncurve.\nReynold presents the following potential hedge fund investments:\nHedge Fund 1: A relative value strategy fund focusing only on fixed-income arbitrage.\nHedge Fund 2: An equity strategy fund focusing only on Long/short equity strategies.\nHedge Fund 3: An opportunistic strategy fund focusing on global macro strategies.",

Sessions were available covering a wide range\nof topics, including managing individual investor portfolios, lifetime financial advice, setting asset\nallocation policies, and applying risk tolerance concepts to asset allocation. The Jones Family Case\nStudy, shown in Exhibit 1, provided a helpful framework to present and discuss many of the\nconcepts. The moderator, Vince Dunne, conducted the sessions using panel discussions and\nlectures, each followed by question and answer (Q&A) periods.\n<image_1>\nThe initial session on lifetime financial advice evolved into a discussion of the concept of\nhuman capital. The speaker briefly described how the present value of an individual's lifetime of\nincome can be considered as an asset class that should be viewed in relation to financial assets.\nDuring the lengthy Q&A period, Reyder made the following additional notes:\n• Term life insurance is superior to lifetime payout annuities when attempting to hedge\nagainst the risks of the loss of human capital.\n• Risk tolerance of the combined portfolio of financial assets and human capital increases\nproportionally with greater human capital regardless of wage earnings risk.\n• The magnitude of loss of human capital at younger ages is less important than the higher\nprobability of death at older ages.\nDuring a discussion of ways Gladys could achieve her stated goal, the following statements\nwere made:\n• A jointly owned fixed annuity lifetime payout would achieve her goal as well as providing\npurchasing power protection.\n• A jointly owned variable payout lifetime annuity product would also meet her goal but\nwould provide less certainty in terms of cash flow.\n• Although annuity products would help, it is more important to change the asset allocation of\nthe joint portfolio toward less risk.\nMark's stated goal prompted a review of the use of trusts to implement investment and\nestate planning strategies. Reyder was unfamiliar with trusts. After listening to Dunne's lecture on\nthe topic, Reyder summed up the possibilities to see if she had heard him correctly.\n\"In establishing an irrevocable trust, Peter would be the grantor and Mark would be the\nbeneficiary. A motivation for using this structure could be for Peter to make resources available to\nMark without yielding control of those resources to him. A discretionary irrevocable trust could\nenable the trustee to determine how much to distribute to Mark from time to time based on\nMark's general welfare, but the assets cannot be protected from claims made by Mark's\ncreditors.\"",

From her files for the\nMcLoughlin family, Buylak notes the following facts, which she thinks might be relevant in the\nmeeting:\n• Kasey was Bryn's second wife.\n• Bryn had been the sole provider for his grandson Paulo for the past 20 years; Paulo was\norphaned at the age of three and initially lived with Bryn and his first wife. Mainly as a result\nof the stress arising from the disabilities and medical problems that Paulo developed, Bryn's\nfirst marriage ended in divorce within one year. Two years later, it was determined that\nPaulo would be better off living in a private care facility in the sunny warm climate of\nIzlandia, where he continues to live today.\n• To ensure that Paulo's future needs would be met, shortly after the child was orphaned,\nBryn purchased a €3 million life insurance policy on his own life for a one-time premium of\n€500,000. At the same time, Bryn's father bought a similar, but smaller, policy on his own life.\nOwnership of both policies was transferred to a discretionary irrevocable trust with Paulo as\nthe primary beneficiary and the University of Izlandia as the remainderman.\n• Buylak was appointed as the investment adviser for the trust.\n• Bryn and Kasey were married two years after Bryn's divorce from his first wife.\nBuylak had been faxed a copy of Bryn's will and in combination with other information she\nhad available made the following notes:\n• Two years ago, Bryn disposed of his very successful construction company and invested the\nproceeds in two overseas distribution centers. The first property is located in the country of\nLandlochen, and at the time of his death it was jointly owned with Kasey with the right of\nsurvivorship. For the second of these properties, Bryn's will named Paulo as the beneficiary\nof the property. The property is located in Izlandia, where Paulo resides.\n• Kasey was named the beneficiary of Bryn's taxable account and two tax-advantaged\nretirement accounts.\n• Weshvia, Izlandia, and Landlochen all use the euro, and none of the three tax regimes\nimpose any tax consequences on spousal transfers either before or after death.\nAs they begin their meeting, Kasey first asks Buylak if any of the provisions of the life\ninsurance policy or dispositions of the investment properties might be challenged in the probate\nprocess.\nKasey mentions to Buylak that she is aware that a large part of her wealth now depends on\nthe investment property in Landlochen. She asks Buylak what cash flow will be available to her\nannually after taxes from its lease income and what after-tax cash proceeds she might obtain if the property were to be sold when the current lease expires. Buylak had prepared for these\nquestions, and her responses were based on the following:\n• The investment real estate property in Landlochen had a cost basis of €2,900,000 and has a\npresent market value of €3,000,000. It produces income of €450,000 (pre-tax) annually\nthrough a lease agreement that expires in five years.\n• After reviewing several reports analyzing Landlochen real estate values, Buylak estimates\nthat the property could be sold at the termination of the lease at 30% above its present\nmarket value.\n• The tax structure in Landlochen differs from Kasey's home country Weshvia, as shown in\nExhibit 1. Fortunately, there is a provision for some relief from double taxation. Weshvia\nallows use of the deduction method with regard to income taxes and the credit method\ntoward capital gains.\n<image_1>\nOn the basis of her calculations for the cash flows from the Landlochen investment property,\nBuylak recommends that the three inherited investment accounts be held for the next 12 years\nwith all earnings and gains reinvested. In anticipation of another after-tax cash flow question, she\nestimates the accrual equivalent after-tax rate of return on the portfolio of combined accounts\nover the next 12 year period using the information in Exhibit 2.\n<image_2>",

        "context": "Rhys Jacobs is a 70-year-old resident of Sahjong, a small island country off the coast of Australia\nthat caters to high-net-worth individuals because of its low tax rates and status as a sought-after\nfree trade zone. Jacobs grew up in Sahjong and is a well-respected entrepreneur.\nJacobs has long put it off but believes that now is the time to finally receive some\nmuch-needed assistance in tax-efficient wealth accumulation, retirement and estate planning,\nand other financial matters, so he recently hired Jassica Simson as his tax and financial adviser.\nIn preparing for their introductory meeting, Jacobs performs initial research on various taxplanning strategies available in Sahjong, where the capital gains tax rate is much lower than the\nincome tax rate. He finds several strategies that might be appropriate for his investment portfolio\nand summarizes them as follows:\n1 A strategy based on low portfolio turnover whereby assets are held for extended periods.\n2 A strategy that concentrates on tax- exempt securities.\n3 A strategy to restructure his portfolio to focus on annual capital gains versus income\ngeneration.\nJacobs provides materials to Simson, including the following notes he took from a recent\nfinancial blog discussing the various tools currently being used in retirement planning:\n1 Long-term market return and historical inflation averages are simple but effective strategies\nfor accurately extrapolating how much wealth will be accumulated after a period of time if\none could earn, say, 10% a year.\n2 The Monte Carlo approach helps an investor get to a straightforward “yes/no” determination\non whether a particular retirement income goal can be achieved.\n3 Given a particular investment strategy, the likelihood of achieving a certain percentage return\nthroughout retirement can be answered with a Monte Carlo simulation.\n4 Sustainable spending rates in retirement can be approximated without the need for a Monte\nCarlo simulation by using the notion of ruin probabilities.\nJacobs asks Simson to evaluate these notes.\nSimson states that she is very much in favor of a long-term buy-and-hold strategy focused on\ncapital appreciation. She states that investors often do not realize just how much of their\ninvestment returns are consumed by taxes, and she provides Jacobs with the data in Exhibit 1 to\nillustrate the point.\n<image_1>\nTurning to retirement planning, Simson confirms that sustainable spending rates in retirement\ncan be approximated without the need for a Monte Carlo simulation by using the notion of ruin\nprobabilities. The analysis incorporates lifespan uncertainty as well as financial market risk. After\nthey discuss the method, Jacobs asks her to determine how much he could withdraw annually\nfrom a balanced portfolio if he wants to be at least 94% certain that the portfolio will last for the\nremainder of his life. He states that the current value of his (balanced) portfolio is $2 million,\nmade up of 50% income-producing equities and 50% bonds. Simson uses the ruin probabilities in\nExhibit 2 as the basis for her calculation of Jacobs’ lifetime sustainable annual withdrawal.\n<image_2>\nThe oil firm that Jacobs controls is headquartered in the island country of Mahjong,located\nnear Sahjong. Because of the foreign location of the oil firm, Simson believes there might be\nopportunities to reduce taxes.\nSimson knows that Sahjong uses the exemption method, whereby it does not impose taxes\non income that stems from a foreign country. However, Sahjong will soon hold parliamentary\nelections, and the opposition party is said to favor the deduction method. Simson plans to\ninvestigate how this possible change might affect Jacobs’ tax liability. She compares the tax rates\nin the two countries in Exhibit 3.\n<image_3>",

McClelland has been engaged by Bradley and Reagan Graham to develop a\npersonal wealth management plan. Prior to meeting with McClelland, the Grahams filled out a\npersonal profile questionnaire that will be used in developing their wealth management plan.\nUsing information from the questionnaire, McClelland prepares Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\n<image_2>\n<image_3>\n<image_4>\nAt their initial meeting, Bradley tells McClelland that he recently attended a financial\nplanning seminar conducted by his employer’s human resources department. One of the\npresenters discussed the importance of preparing and understanding the components of an\neconomic balance sheet compared with a traditional balance sheet. Bradley was confused by a\nfew of the presenter’s comments and asks McClelland for further clarification. The presenter’s\ncomments were as follows:\n• Real estate can be described as a personal asset, an investment asset, and a mixed asset.\n• Financial capital consists of tangible and intangible assets, including both the vested and\nunvested portions of an employer pension plan.\n• The value of human capital relative to overall economic wealth is typically higher for an\nindividual in mid-career with an established earnings record than for an individual in the\nearly stages of his career.\nAs McClelland reviews insurance coverage with the Grahams, he explains that there are\nvarious ways to manage risk. “It depends on the frequency of a risk occurring and the severity of\nthe potential loss. For example, consider the following two risks:\n• An earthquake: This risk seldom occurs but would result in a large financial loss;\n• Dental cavities: This risk arises frequently, resulting in small financial losses.”\nMcClelland determines that both Bradley’s and Reagan’s life insurance coverage is\ninadequate. Bradley is particularly concerned about the inadequacy of his life insurance and asks\nMcClelland to calculate how much additional insurance he should purchase to cover him until he\nretires in exactly 15 years and begins to receive his employer pension. McClelland prefers to use\nthe human life value method to determine the appropriate level of life insurance coverage.\nExhibit 2 contains additional personal and financial information about Bradley.\n<image_5>\nThe Grahams mention that a primary concern is the ability to manage the risks to both their financial and human capital so that they can achieve their financial goals of maintaining a\ncomfortable lifestyle while having sufficient assets to purchase a vacation home, pay for their\nchildren’s university education, and fund charitable donations.\nBradley mentions that he and Reagan have some concern about possibly outliving their assets\nand that he understands annuities can help protect against this risk. He is interested in an annuity\nthat will provide income for as long as one of them is alive. The Grahams have average risk\ntolerance and expect they will be able to adjust their spending in retirement if necessary.",

He\nmeets with Henry Ford, who plans to retire in 12 years and wants to discuss his retirement goals.\nFord gives the following background information to Richard:\n“My house will need a major renovation in 12 years, which will cost approximately\n$500,000. My current income is sufficient for my expenses, but in retirement, I estimate annual\nafter-tax living costs to be $100,000 rising with inflation, which is expected to continue at 3\npercent annually. In retirement, my primary objective is to maintain my current lifestyle.”\nRichard suggests using annuities to analyze Ford’s retirement needs. In response, Ford feels\nhe is willing to pay a lump sum in exchange for the fixed payments, but he wants to maintain\ncontrol over his assets. He also shows his concern over the high cost of annuities.\nFord continues, I have a secondary objective to gift $1 million to my daughter in 15 years. I\nprefer low volatility investments. My portfolio assets include safe investments – 40% large-cap\ndividend-paying blue-chip equities, 40% government Treasury bills and investment-grade\ncorporate bonds, and 20% real estate. I wish to grow my assets over my 12 years investment\nhorizon to meet my retirement goals.”\nRichard decides to implement a goal-based investing approach and runs a Monte Carlo\nsimulation to determine the probability of success - the likelihood that Ford can meet his gifting\nobjectives. The simulation results are reproduced in Exhibit 1.\n<image_1>\nAs the meeting concludes, Richard hands out a client feedback form, where Ford is asked to\ngive a performance review of the wealth adviser. Ford comments that Richard listened to his\nvarious retirement objectives and understood his goals. He had a working knowledge of\ntraditional and alternative asset classes.

Cameron Li, has been charged with conducting\nthe appraisal and is to report back to upper management with his findings.\nLi is convinced that trade executions play a substantial role in overall portfolio performance,\nparticularly for funds that have a relatively high level of turnover during the year. As a result, he is\nseeking methods that will allow him to evaluate the quality of trade executions.\nHe first consults the firm’s head trader, Rick Gleeson, about the relationship between trade\nurgency, market impact and execution risk. Gleeson makes the following two statements.\nStatement 1: Market impact increases when large orders are traded with higher urgency.\nStatement 2: Trading with lower urgency is associated with lower execution risk.\nLi asks Gleeson for some recent trade data that he can use for analysis and presentation to\nmanagement. He receives the following data relating to a series of buy trades for Sumatra\nNatural Resources (SNR), with all currency values in Singapore dollars:\n<image_1>\nGleeson also tells Li that the portfolio manager had originally made the decision to purchase\n5,000 SNR shares at 10:00 am when the price was $22.26. Gleeson released the order to the\nmarket at 10:20 am when the price was $22.29. The closing price for the day was Gleeson’s last\ntrade at $22.65, at which point the order for the remaining 2,000 shares was cancelled. Gleeson\nexecuted the trade at an average price of $22.47 and total commissions paid amounted to $210.\nGleeson subsequently provides Li with a summary of the algorithmic trading strategies that\nhe has used in the last month. Li notes that a significant number of Gleeson’s algorithmic trades\nhave been executed using arrival price algorithms.",

One\nof TWA’s clients is a large pension fund of DaMi Corporation, its CEO Ares Lei is considering\nadding an equity strategy into the pension’s portfolio, and he asks Prince to initiate a manager\nselection process. Prince begins the selection process by defining feasible manager universe and\nmakes the following statements:\nStatement 1: One approach to build a universe of managers is excluding managers based on\nhistorical risk-adjusted returns.\nStatement 2: When defining this manager universe, the selection process should identify the\nbenchmark against which managers will be evaluated.\nStatement 3: It’s an efficient way to use third-party categorizations of managers to find those\nthat might fill the desired role in the portfolio.\nAfter building the appropriate manager universe, Prince inspects the risk attribution\napproach to apply for evaluating those candidate managers. One of the candidate managers is\nManager J. Manager J specializes in timing sector exposure and generally avoids idiosyncratic\nrisks within sectors. Using technical analyses and econometric methodologies, she produces\nseveral types of forecasts. The manager uses this information to determine appropriate sector\nweights. The risk contribution from any single sector is limited to 20% of total portfolio risk. She\nhedges aggregate market risk and seeks to earn T-bills plus 200 bps.\nPrince also prepares the following estimates of Manager J’s 10-year risk-adjusted-performance.\n<image_1>\nAs a part of the investment due diligence process, Prince interviews those candidate\nmanagers. During the interview, Manager U, one of the managers, tells Prince that he captures\nalpha by identifying and exploiting structural inefficiencies that are created by external or\ninternal rules and regulations.\nManager U also states that if the inefficiency is a unique event that occurs infrequently, and\nthe level of gross return is greater than the amount of transaction costs and expenses, and the\naggregate value of all assets affected by the inefficiency is larger than the AUM of the manager\nand its competitors, then the investment process of exploiting a structural inefficiency is\nrepeatable.\nAnother client of TWA is a foundation, which is considering investing in a fixed income fund\ncalled Wonder Fund. Barry Allen, the CIO of the foundation investment committee, asks Prince to review the performance results of the fund. Prince conducts an exposure decomposition analysis.\nExhibit 2 below gives the Wonder Fund’s attribution results.\n<image_2>",

Fund A offers the potential for increasing the portfolio’s return, but is too highly correlated to provide substantial volatility reduction benefits through diversification. Fund B provides substantial volatility reduction through diversification benefits, but is expected to generate a return well below the current portfolio’s return.

        "explanation": "The expected return for Portfolio F equals the risk-free rate since its beta equals 0. For Portfolio A, the ratio of risk premium to beta is: (12 − 6)/1.2 = 5\nFor Portfolio E, the ratio is lower at: (8 – 6)/0.6 = 3.33\nThis implies that an arbitrage opportunity exists. For instance, you can create a Portfolio G with beta equal to 0.6 (the same as E’s) by combining Portfolio A and Portfolio F in equal weights. The expected return and beta for Portfolio G are then:\nE(rG ) = (0.5 × 12%) + (0.5 × 6%) = 9%\nβG =(0.5×1.2)+(0.5×0%)=0.6\nComparing Portfolio G to Portfolio E, G has the same beta and higher return. Therefore, an arbitrage opportunity exists by buying Portfolio G and selling an equal amount of Portfolio E. The profit for this arbitrage will be:\nrG –rE =[9%+(0.6×F)]−[8%+(0.6×F)]=1% That is, 1% of the funds (long or short) in each portfolio.",

First, we need to calculate the unlevered cost of equity. According to Modigliani-Miller Proposition II with corporate taxes:\n$R_S = R_0 + (B/S)(R_0 – R_B)(1 – t_C) .16 = R_0 + (.50)(R_0 – .09)(1 – .40)$\n$R_0 = .1438, or\\, 14.38\\%$\nNow we can find the NPV of an all-equity project, which is:\nNPV = PV(Unlevered Cash Flows)\n$NPV = –\\$15,100,000 + \\$5,400,000 / 1.1438 + \\$8,900,000 / 1.14382 + \\$8,600,000 / 1.14383 NPV = \\$2,169,595.50$\nNext, we need to find the net present value of financing side effects. This is equal to the aftertax present value of cash flows resulting from the firm’s debt. So:\nNPV = Proceeds – Aftertax PV(Interest Payments) – PV(Principal Payments)\nEach year, an equal principal payment will be made, which will reduce the interest accrued during the year. Given a known level of debt, debt cash flows should be discounted at the pre-tax cost of debt, so the NPV of the financing effects is:\n$NPV = \\$8,700,000 – (1 – .40)(.09)(\\$8,700,000) / 1.09 – \\$2,900,000 / 1.09 \n– (1 – .40)(.09)(\\$5,800,000) / 1.092 – \\$2,900,000 / 1.09^2\n– (1 – .40)(.09)(\\$2,900,000) / 1.093 – \\$2,900,000 / 1.09^3$\n$NPV = \\$543,698.19$\nSo, the APV of project is:\nAPV = NPV(All-equity) + NPV(Financing side effects) \n$APV = \\$2,169,595.50 + 543,698.19$\n$APV = \\$2,713,293.68$",

At time zero, we have\na stock whose price per share we denote by $S_0$, a positive quantity known at time zero. At time one, the price per share of this stock will be one of two\npositive values, which we denote $S_1(H)$ and $S_1(T)$, the $H$ and $T$ standing for head and tail, respectively. Thus, we are imagining that a coin is tossed,\nand the outcome of the coin toss determines the price at time one. We do not assume this coin is fair (i.e., the probability of head need not be one-half).\nWe assume only that the probability of head, which we call $p$, is positive, and the probability of tail, which is $q = 1 - p$, is also positive.\n\nThe outcome of the coin toss, and hence the value which the stock price will take at time one, is known at $t$ ime one but not at time zero. We shall\nrefer to any quantity not known at time zero as ran dom because it depends on $t$ he random experiment of tossing a coin. We introduce the two positive numbers $u = \\frac{S_1(H)}{S_0}, \\quad d = \\frac{S_1(T)}{S_0}$. We assume that $d < u$; We refer to $u$ as the \\textit{up factor} and $d$ as the \\textit{down factor}. \n\n\nWe introduce also an \\textit{interest rate} $r$. One dollar invested in the money\nmarket at time zero will yield \\$1 + r$ dollars at time one. Conversely, one dollar\nborrowed from the money market at time zero will result in a debt of \\$1 + r$\nat time one. In particular, the interest rate for borrowing is the same as the\ninterest rate for investing. It is almost always true that $r > 0$, and this is the\ncase to keep in mind. \n\nAn essential feature of an efficient market is that if a trading strategy can\nturn nothing into something, we can be sure the possibility of loss. Otherwise,\nthere would be an \\textit{arbitrage}. More specifically, we define \\textit{arbitrage} as a trading\nstrategy that begins with no money, has zero probability of losing money,\nand has a positive probability of making money. A mathematical model that\nadmits arbitrage cannot be used for analysis. ",

        "explanation": "The inequality $d > 0$ follows from the positivity of the stock prices and was already assumed. The two other inequalities follow from the absence of arbitrage, as we now explain. If $ d \\geq 1 + r $, one could begin with zero wealth and at time zero borrow from the money market one stock at time one will be worth even more. Even in the worst case of a tail on the coin toss, the stock at time one will be high enough to pay off the money market debt and still have a positive probability of being worth strictly more since $ d \\geq 1 + r $. This provides an arbitrage. On the other hand, if $ u \\leq 1 + r $, one could sell the stock short and invest the proceeds in the money market. Even in the best case for the stock, the cost of replacing it at time one will be less than or equal to the value of the money market investment, and since $ d < u \\leq 1 + r $, there is a positive probability that the cost of replacing the stock will be strictly less than the value of the money market investment. This again provides an arbitrage.",

This is not surprising, since this is exactly the cost of replicating $S_1$.\nThis illustrates an important point. The “fair price” of a stock cannot be determined by the risk-neutral pricing, as seen below. Suppose $S_1(H)$ and $S_1(T)$ are given, we could have two current prices, $S_0$ and $S'_0$. Correspondingly, we can get $u$, $d$ and $u'$, $d'$. Because they are determined by $S_0$ and $S'_0$, respectively, it’s not surprising that risk-neutral pricing formula always holds, in both cases. That is,\n$$S_0=\\frac{\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}S_1(H)+\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d}S_1(T)}{1+r}, S'_0\\equiv\\frac{\\frac{1+r-d'}{u'-d'}S_1(H)+\\frac{u'-1-r}{u'-d'}S_1(T)}{1+r}.$$\nEssentially, this is because risk-neutral pricing relies on fair price=replication cost.

To calculate the sustainable growth rate, we first need to calculate the ROE, which is:\n ROE = NI / TE \n ROE = $14,190 / $83,000 \n ROE = .1710\n The plowback ratio, b, is one minus the payout ratio, so:\n b = 1 – .30 \n b = .70\n Now we can use the sustainable growth rate equation to get:\n Sustainable growth rate = (ROE × b) / [1 – (ROE × b)]\n Sustainable growth rate = [.1710(.70)] / [1 – .1710(.70)] \n Sustainable growth rate = .1359, or 13.59%\n So, the maximum dollar increase in sales is:\n Maximum increase in sales = $43,000(.1359) \n Maximum increase in sales = $5,845.58",

The cash flows for the contract are annual, and we are given a daily interest rate. We need to find the EAR so the interest compounding is the same as the timing of the cash flows. The EAR is:\n EAR = [1 + (.057/365)]^{365} – 1 \n EAR = .0587, or 5.87%\n The PV of the current contract offer is the sum of the PV of the cash flows. So, the PV is:\n PV = $8,500,000 + $3,900,000 / 1.0587 + $4,600,000 / 1.0587^{2} + $5,300,000 / 1.0587^{3} + $5,800,000 / 1.0587^{4} + $6,400,000 / 1.0587^{5} + $7,300,000 / 1.0587^{6} \n PV = $35,371,651.95\n The player wants the contract increased in value by $2,700,000, so the PV of the new contract will be:\n PV = $35,371,651.95 + 2,700,000\n PV = $38,071,651.95\n The player has also requested a signing bonus payable today in the amount of $10 million. We can subtract this amount from the PV of the new contract. The remaining amount will be the PV of the future quarterly paychecks.\n $38,071,651.95 – 10,000,000 = $28,071,651.95\n To find the quarterly payments, first realize that the interest rate we need is the effective quarterly rate. Using the daily interest rate, we can find the quarterly interest rate using the EAR equation, with the number of days being 91.25, the number of days in a quarter (365 / 4). The effective quarterly rate is:\n Effective quarterly rate = [1 + (.057 / 365)]91.25 – 1 \n Effective quarterly rate = .01435 or 1.435%\n Now, we have the interest rate, the length of the annuity, and the PV. Using the PVA equation and solving for the payment, we get:\n PVA = $28,071,651.95 = C{[1 – (1 / 1.01435)^{24}] / .01435} \n C = $1,390,909.66",

Because Projects A and C have the same initial investment, the problem of scale does not arise when comparing the profitability indexes. Based on the profitability index rule, Project C can be eliminated because its PI is less than the PI of Project A. Because of the problem of scale, we cannot compare the PIs of Projects A and B. However, we can calculate the PI of the incremental cash flows of the two projects, which are:\n <ans_image_1>\n When calculating incremental cash flows, remember to subtract the cash flows of the project with the smaller initial cash outflow from those of the project with the larger initial cash outflow. This procedure insures that the incremental initial cash outflow will be negative. The incremental PI calculation is:\n PI(B – A) = [$135,000 / 1.12 + $135,000 / 1.12^{2}] / $225,000\n PI(B – A) = 1.014\n The company should accept Project B since the PI of the incremental cash flows is greater than one.",

We know this because the subsequent cash flows from Project Billion are larger than the subsequent cash flows from Project Million. So, subtracting the Project Million cash flows from the Project Billion cash flows, we find the incremental cash flows are:\n <ans_image_1>\n Now we can find the present value of the subsequent incremental cash flows at the discount rate, 12 percent. The present value of the incremental cash flows is:\n PV = $1,200 + $240 / 1.12 + $240 / 1.12^{2} + $400 / 1.12^{3}\n PV = $1,890.32\n So, if I0 is greater than $1,890.32, the incremental cash flows will be negative. Since we are subtracting Project Million from Project Billion, this implies that for any value over $1,890.32 the NPV of Project Billion will be less than that of Project Million, so I0 must be less than $1,890.32.",

        "explanation": "Probably the easiest OCF calculation for this problem is the bottom up approach, so we will construct an income statement for each year. Beginning with the initial cash flow at time zero, the project will require an investment in equipment. The project will also require an investment in NWC of $1,500,000. So, the cash flow required for the project today will be:\n <ans_image_1>\n Now we can begin the remaining calculations. Sales figures are given for each year, along with the price per unit. The variable costs per unit are used to calculate total variable costs, and fixed costs are given at $1,850,000 per year. To calculate depreciation each year, we use the initial equipment cost of $19.5 million, times the appropriate MACRS depreciation each year. The remainder of each income statement is calculated below. Notice at the bottom of the income statement we added back depreciation to get the OCF for each year. The section labeled “Net cash flows” will be discussed below:\n <ans_image_2>\n After we calculate the OCF for each year, we need to account for any other cash flows. The other cash flows in this case are NWC cash flows and capital spending, which is the aftertax salvage of the equipment. The required NWC is 15 percent of the sales increase in the next year. We will work through the NWC cash flow for Year 1. The total NWC in Year 1 will be 15 percent of the sales increase from Year 1 to Year 2, or:\n Increase in NWC for Year 1 = .15($27,945,000 – 30,705,000) \n Increase in NWC for Year 1 = –$414,000\n Notice that the NWC cash flow is negative. Since the sales are increasing, we will have to spend more money to increase NWC. In Year 3, the NWC cash flow becomes positive when sales are declining. And, in Year 5, the NWC cash flow is the recovery of all NWC the company still has in the project. \n To calculate the aftertax salvage value, we first need the book value of the equipment. The book value at the end of the five years will be the purchase price, minus the total depreciation. So, the ending book value is:\n Ending book value = $19,500,000 – ($2,786,500 + 4,775,550 + 3,410,550 + 2,435,550 + 1,741,350) \n Ending book value = $4,350,450\n The market value of the used equipment is 20 percent of the purchase price, or $3.9 million, so the aftertax salvage value will be:\n Aftertax salvage value = $3,900,000 + ($4,350,450 – 3,900,000)(.35) \n Aftertax salvage value = $4,057,658\n The aftertax salvage value is included in the total cash flows as capital spending. Now we have all of the cash flows for the project. The NPV of the project is:\n NPV = –$21,000,000 + $7,519,543 / 1.18 + $9,021,693 / 1.18^{2} + $10,022,693 / 1.18^{3} + $9,695,193 / 1.18^{4} + $12,515,380 / 1.18^{5}\n NPV = $8,423,113.19",

        "explanation": "Probably the easiest OCF calculation for this problem is the bottom up approach, so we will construct an income statement for each year. Beginning with the initial cash flow at time zero, the project will require an investment in equipment. The project will also require an investment in NWC of $1,500,000. So, the cash flow required for the project today will be:\n <ans_image_1>\n Now we can begin the remaining calculations. Sales figures are given for each year, along with the price per unit. The variable costs per unit are used to calculate total variable costs, and fixed costs are given at $1,850,000 per year. To calculate depreciation each year, we use the initial equipment cost of $19.5 million, times the appropriate MACRS depreciation each year. The remainder of each income statement is calculated below. Notice at the bottom of the income statement we added back depreciation to get the OCF for each year. The section labeled “Net cash flows” will be discussed below:\n <ans_image_2>\n After we calculate the OCF for each year, we need to account for any other cash flows. The other cash flows in this case are NWC cash flows and capital spending, which is the aftertax salvage of the equipment. The required NWC is 15 percent of the sales increase in the next year. We will work through the NWC cash flow for Year 1. The total NWC in Year 1 will be 15 percent of the sales increase from Year 1 to Year 2, or:\n Increase in NWC for Year 1 = .15($27,945,000 – 30,705,000) \n Increase in NWC for Year 1 = –$414,000\n Notice that the NWC cash flow is negative. Since the sales are increasing, we will have to spend more money to increase NWC. In Year 3, the NWC cash flow becomes positive when sales are declining. And, in Year 5, the NWC cash flow is the recovery of all NWC the company still has in the project. \n To calculate the aftertax salvage value, we first need the book value of the equipment. The book value at the end of the five years will be the purchase price, minus the total depreciation. So, the ending book value is:\n Ending book value = $19,500,000 – ($2,786,500 + 4,775,550 + 3,410,550 + 2,435,550 + 1,741,350) \n Ending book value = $4,350,450\n The market value of the used equipment is 20 percent of the purchase price, or $3.9 million, so the aftertax salvage value will be:\n Aftertax salvage value = $3,900,000 + ($4,350,450 – 3,900,000)(.35) \n Aftertax salvage value = $4,057,658\n The aftertax salvage value is included in the total cash flows as capital spending. Now we have all of the cash flows for the project. \n The IRR is:\n IRR = 0 = –$21,000,000 + $7,519,543 / (1 + IRR) + $9,021,693 / (1 + IRR)^{2} + $10,022,693 / (1 + IRR)^{3} + $9,695,193 / (1 + IRR)^{4} + $12,515,380 / (1 + IRR)^{5}\n IRR = 33.29%",

The company can continue to rent the building to the present occupants for $60,000 per year. The present occupants have indicated an interest in staying in the building for at least \n another 15 years. Alternatively, the company could modify the existing structure to use for its own manufacturing and warehousing needs. The company’s production engineer feels the building could be adapted to handle one of two new product lines. The cost and \n revenue data for the two product alternatives are as follows:\n <image_1>\n The building will be used for only 15 years for either Product A or Product B. After 15 years the building will be too small for efficient production of either product line. At that time, the company plans to rent the building to firms similar to the current occupants. To rent the building again, the company will need to restore the building to its present layout. The estimated cash cost of restoring the building if Product A has been undertaken is $75,000. If Product B has been manufactured, the cash cost will be $85,000. These cash costs can be deducted for tax purposes in the year the expenditures occur. \n The company will depreciate the original building shell (purchased for $1,250,000) over a 30-year life to zero, regardless of which alternative it chooses. The building \n modifications and equipment purchases for either product are estimated to have a 15-year life. They will be depreciated by the straight-line method. The firm’s tax rate is 34 percent, and its required rate of return on such investments is 12 percent.\n For simplicity, assume all cash flows occur at the end of the year.

        "explanation": "To answer this question, we need to compute the NPV of all three alternatives, specifically, continue to rent the building, Project A, or Project B. We would choose the project with the highest NPV. If all three of the projects have a positive NPV, the project that is more favorable is the one with the highest NPV\n There are several important cash flows we should not consider in the incremental cash flow analysis. The remaining fraction of the value of the building and depreciation are not incremental and should not be included in the analysis of the two alternatives. The $1,250,000 purchase price of the building is the same for all three options and should be ignored. In effect, what we are doing is finding the NPV of the future cash flows of each option, so the only cash flow today would be the building modifications needed for Project A and Project B. If we did include these costs, the effect would be to lower the NPV of all three options by the same amount, thereby leading to the same conclusion. The cash flows from renting the building after Year 15 are also irrelevant. No matter what the company chooses today, it will rent the building after Year 15, so these cash flows are not incremental to any project.\n We will begin by calculating the NPV of the decision of continuing to rent the building first.\n Continue to rent:\n <ans_image_1>\n Since there is no incremental depreciation, the operating cash flow is the net income. So, the NPV of the decision to continue to rent is:\n NPV = $39,600(PVIFA_{12%15})\n NPV = $269,710.23\n Product A: \n Next, we will calculate the NPV of the decision to modify the building to produce Product A. The income statement for this modification is the same for the first 14 years, and in Year 15, the company will have an additional expense to convert the building back to its original form. This will be an expense in Year 15, so the income statement for that year will be slightly different. The cash flow at time zero will be the cost of the equipment, and the cost of the initial building modifications, both of which are depreciable on a straight-line basis. So, the pro forma cash flows for Product A are:\n Initial cash outlay:\n <ans_image_2>\n The OCF each year is net income plus depreciation. So, the NPV for modifying the building to manufacture Product A is:\n NPV = –$335,000 + $106,593(PVIFA_{12%14}) + $57,093 / 1.1215\n NPV = $381,949.28\n Product B: \n Now we will calculate the NPV of the decision to modify the building to produce Product B. The income statement for this modification is the same for the first 14 years, and in Year 15, the company will have an additional expense to convert the building back to its original form. This will be an expense in Year 15, so the income statement for that year will be slightly different. The cash flow at time zero will be the cost of the equipment, and the cost of the initial building modifications, both of which are depreciable on a straight-line basis. So, the pro forma cash flows for Product B are:\n Initial cash outlay:\n <ans_image_3>\n The OCF each year is net income plus depreciation. So, the NPV for modifying the building to manufacture Product B is:\n NPV = –$405,000 + $114,780(PVIFA_{12%14}) + $58,680 / 1.1215\n NPV = $366,501.77\n Since Product A has the highest NPV, the company should opt for that product.\n We could have also done the analysis as the incremental cash flows between Product A and continuing to rent the building, and the incremental cash flows between Product B and continuing to rent the building. The results of this type of analysis would be:\n NPV of differential cash flows between Product A and continuing to rent:\n NPV = NPV_{product A} – NPV_{Rent}\n NPV = $381,949.28 – 269,710.23\n NPV = $112,239.05\n NPV of differential cash flows between Product B and continuing to rent:\n NPV = NPVProduct B – NPVRent\n NPV = $366,501.77 – 269,710.23\n NPV = $96,791.53\n Since the differential NPV of Product A is positive and is the largest incremental NPV, the company should choose Project A, which is the same as our original result.",

        "explanation": "The discount rate is expressed in real terms, and the cash flows are expressed in nominal terms. We can answer this question by converting all of the cash flows to real dollars. We can then use the real interest rate. The real value of each cash flow is the present value of the Year 1 nominal cash flows, discounted back to the present at the inflation rate. So, the real value of the revenue and costs will be: \n Revenue in real terms = $325,000 / 1.06 = $306,603.77\n Labor costs in real terms = $197,000 / 1.06 = $185,849.06\n Other costs in real terms = $64,000 / 1.06 = $60,377.36\n Lease payment in real terms = $150,000 / 1.06 = $141,509.43\n Revenues, labor costs, and other costs are all growing perpetuities. Each has a different growth rate, so we must calculate the present value of each separately. Using the real required return, the present value of each of these is:\n PVRevenue = $306,603.77 / (.10 – .04) = $5,110,062.89\n PVLabor costs = $185,849.06 / (.10 – .03) = $2,654,986.52\n PVOther costs = $60,377.36 / (.10 – .01) = $670,859.54\n The lease payments are constant in nominal terms, so they are declining in real terms by the inflation rate. Therefore, the lease payments form a growing perpetuity with a negative growth rate. The real present value of the lease payments is:\n PVLease payments = $141,509.43 / [.10 – (–.06)] = $884,433.96\n Now we can use the tax shield approach to calculate the net present value. Since there is no investment in equipment, there is no depreciation; therefore, no depreciation tax shield, so we will ignore this in our calculation. This means the cash flows each year are equal to net income. There is also no initial cash outlay, so the NPV is the present value of the future aftertax cash flows. The NPV of the project is:\n NPV = (PVRevenue – PVLabor costs – PVOther costs – PVLease payments)(1 – tC)\n NPV = ($5,110,062.89 – 2,654,986.52 – 670,859.54 – 884,433.96)(1 – .34)\n NPV = $593,856.69\n In general, we can answer capital budgeting problems in nominal terms as well. However, in this case, the computation would have been impossible. The reason is that we are dealing with growing perpetuities. In other problems, when calculating the NPV of nominal cash flows, we could calculate the nominal cash flow each year since the cash flows were finite. Because of the perpetual nature of the cash flows in this problem, we cannot calculate the nominal cash flows each year until the end of the project. When faced with two alternative approaches, where both are equally correct, always choose the simplest one.",

        "explanation": "We can use the expected returns we calculated to find the slope of the Security Market Line. We know that the beta of Stock A is .25 greater than the beta of Stock B. Therefore, as beta increases by .25, the expected return on a security increases by .018 (= .1190 – .1010). The slope of the security market line (SML) equals:\n SlopeSML = Rise / Run\n SlopeSML = Increase in expected return / Increase in beta\n SlopeSML = (.1190 – .1010) / .25\n SlopeSML = .0720, or 7.20%\n Since the market’s beta is 1 and the risk-free rate has a beta of zero, the slope of the Security Market Line equals the expected market risk premium. So, the expected market risk premium must be 7.2 percent.\n We could also solve this problem using CAPM. The equations for the expected returns of the two stocks are:\n .119 = Rf + (βB + .25)(MRP)\n .101 = Rf + βB(MRP)\n We can rewrite the CAPM equation for Stock A as:\n .119 = Rf + βB(MRP) + .25(MRP)\n Subtracting the CAPM equation for Stock B from this equation yields:\n .018 = .25MRP\n MRP = .0720, or 7.20%\n which is the same answer as our previous result.",

So, the amount available to this shareholder will be:\n Cash flow from Knight to shareholder = .05($580,000 – 84,000) \n Cash flow from Knight to shareholder = $24,800\n Veblen will distribute all of its earnings to shareholders, so the shareholder will receive:\n Cash flow from Veblen to shareholder = .05($580,000) \n Cash flow from Veblen to shareholder = $29,000\n However, to have the same initial cost, the investor has borrowed $52,500 to invest in Veblen, so interest must be paid on the borrowings. The net cash flow from the investment in Veblen will be:\n Net cash flow from Veblen investment = $29,000 – .06($52,500) \n Net cash flow from Veblen investment = $25,850\n For the same initial cost, the investment in Veblen produces a higher dollar return.",

        "context": "The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 1.2 gives the bid and ask quotes for some of the call options trading on Apple (ticker symbol: AAPL), on May 21, 2020. Table 1.3 does the same for put options trading on Apple on that date. The quotes are taken from the CBOE website. The Apple stock price at the time of the quotes was bid 316.23, ask 316.50. The bid–ask spread for an option (as a percent of the price) is usually much greater than that for the underlying stock and depends on the volume of trading. The option strike prices in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are $290, $300, $310, $320, $330, and $340. The maturities are June 2020, September 2020, and December 2020. The precise expiration day is the third Friday of the expiration month. The June options expire on June 19, 2020, the September options on September 18, 2020, and the December options on December 18, 2020.\n The tables illustrate a number of properties of options. The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases.\n <image_1>\n <image_2>",
        "question": "Suppose a trader instructs a broker to buy one December call option contract on Apple with a strike price of $340. The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at the CBOE and the deal will be done. The (ask) price indicated in Table 1.2 is $20.30. This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, an option contract is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the trader must arrange for $2,030 to be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.\n In our example, the trader has obtained at a cost of $2,030 the right to buy 100 Apple shares for $340 each. If the price of Apple does not rise above $340 by December 18, 2020, what will happen?",

The July 2022 contract is shorted at $46.30 per barrel and closed out at $45.90 per barrel for a profit of $0.40 per barrel. The final spot price is $46.\n The dollar gain per barrel of oil from the short futures contracts is\n (48.20 - 47.40) + (47.00 - 46.50) + (46.30 - 45.90) = 1.70\n The oil price declined from $49 to $46. Receiving only $1.70 per barrel compensation for a price decline of $3.00 may appear unsatisfactory. However, we cannot expect total compensation for a price decline when futures prices are below spot prices. The best we can hope for is to lock in the futures price that would apply to a June 2022 contract if it were actively traded.\n In practice, a company usually has an exposure every month to the underlying asset and uses a 1-month futures contract for hedging because it is the most liquid. Initially it enters into (“stacks”) sufficient contracts to cover its exposure to the end of its hedging horizon. One month later, it closes out all the contracts and “rolls” them into new 1-month contracts to cover its new exposure, and so on.",

        "explanation": "The expected life at time zero can be calculated by rolling back through the tree asking the question at each node: \"What is the expected life if the node is reached?\" This is what has been done in Figure S16.1<ans_image_1>. It is assumed that 5% of employees leave at times 2, 4, 6, and 8 years. For example, at node G (time 6 years) there is a 81% chance that the option will be exercised (80% chance that the holder chooses to exercise and a 5% times 20% chance that the holder chooses not to exercise but leaves the company after 6 years) and a 19% chance that it will last an extra two years. The expected life if node G is reached is therefore 0.81×6+0.19×8 = 6.38 years. Similarly, the expected life if node H is reached is 0.335×6+0.665×8=7.33 years. The expected life if node I or J is reached is 0.05×6+0.95×8=7.90 years. The expected life if node D is reached is 0.43×4+0.57×(0.5158×6.38+0.4842×7.33)=5.62\n Continuing in this way, the expected life at time zero is 6.76 years. (As in Example 16.2 we assume that no employees leave at time zero.)",

        "answers": "options on $100,000 (or 1,000 contracts) \n should be purchased",
        "explanation": "When the value of the portfolio falls to $54 million the holder of the portfolio makes a capital loss of 10%. After dividends are taken into account, the loss is 7% during the year. This is 12% below the risk-free interest rate. According to the capital asset pricing model, the expected excess return of the portfolio above the risk-free rate equals beta times the expected \n excess return of the market above the risk-free rate.\n Therefore, when the portfolio provides a return 12% below the risk-free interest rate, the market’s expected return is 6% below the risk-free interest rate. As the index can be assumed to have a beta of 1.0, this is also the excess expected return (including dividends) from the index. The expected return from the index is therefore -1% per annum. Since the index provides a 3% per annum dividend yield, the expected movement in the index is -4%. Thus, when the portfolio’s value is $54 million, the expected value of the index is 0.96*1200=1152. Hence, European put options should be purchased with an exercise price of 1152. Their maturity date should be in one year. \n The number of options required is twice the number required in Problem 17.20. This is because we wish to protect a portfolio which is twice as sensitive to changes in market conditions as the portfolio in Problem 17.20. Hence, options on $100,000 (or 1,000 contracts) should be purchased. To check that the answer is correct, consider what happens when the \n value of the portfolio declines by 20% to $48 million. The return including dividends is -17%. This is 22% less than the risk-free interest rate. The index can be expected to provide a return (including dividends) which is 11% less than the risk-free interest rate, that is, a return of -6%. The index can therefore be expected to drop by 9% to 1092. The payoff from the put options is (1152-1092)*100,000=$6 million. This is exactly what is required to restore the value of the portfolio to $54 million.",

Whereas the growth rate in a non-dividend- paying stock in a risk-neutral world is r , the growth rate in the exchange rate in a risk-neutral world is $r - r_f$ . Exchange rates have low systematic risks and so we can reasonably assume that this is also the growth rate in the real world. In this case, the foreign risk-free rate equals the domestic risk-free rate $( r = r_f )$. The expected growth rate in the exchange rate is therefore zero. If $S_T$ is the exchange rate at time T, its probability distribution is given by equation (14.3) with $\\mu = 0$: $ln S_T \\sim \\phi (ln S_0 - \\sigma^2 T/2, \\sigma^2 T)$\\\\\n where $S_0$ is the exchange rate at time zero and $ \\sigma$ is the volatility of the exchange rate.

In dollars this is worth $SQ\\frac{1+\\bigtriangleup S/S}{Q+\\bigtriangleup Q}$, where $\\bigtriangleup Q$ is the increase in $Q$ . When terms of order two and higher are ignored, the dollar value becomes $S(1+\\bigtriangleup S/S -\\bigtriangleup Q/Q)$. \\\\\n The gain on the Nikkei position is therefore $\\bigtriangleup S -S\\bigtriangleup Q /Q$, when $SQ$ yen are shorted the gain in dollars is $SQ(\\frac{1}{Q}-\\frac{1}{Q+\\bigtriangleup Q})$\\\\\n This equals $S\\bigtriangleup Q / Q$ when terms of order two and higher are ignored.

In this case, A(2.1,2.5) = 0.999685, A(2.1,3.0) = 0.998432, B(2.1,2.5) = 0.396027, and B(2.1,3.0) = 0.88005, and Solver shows that $r^* = 0.065989$.\\\\\n Since $2.5A(2.1,2.5)e^{-B(2.1,2.5)*r^*} = 2.434745$ and $102.5A(2.1,3.0)e^{-B(2.1,3.0)*r^*} = 96.56535$ the call option on the coupon-bearing bond can be decomposed into a call option with a strike\n price of 2.434745 on a bond that pays off 2.5 at time 2.5 years and a call option with a strike price of 96.56535 on a bond that pays off 102.5 at time 3.0 years.\\\\\n The options are valued using equation (32.10). \\\\\n For the first option, $L = 2.5, K = 2.434745, T= 2.1$, and $s = 2.5$.

Furthermore, $\\sigma_P = 0.008176$ and $h = 0.223351$. so that the option price is 0.009084.\\\\\n For the second option, $L = 102.5, K = 96.56535, T= 2.1$, and $s = 3.0$. Also, A(0,T) = 0.991836, B(0,T) = 1.99351, P(0,T) = 0.880022 while A(0,s) = 0.983904, B(0,s) = 2.78584, and P(0,s) = 0.832454.

        "explanation": "The yield curve is flat with a continuously compounded rate of 5.9118\\%.\n As explained in the given pictures, the first stage is to calculate the value of $r $ at time 2.1 years which is such that the value of the bond at that time is 99. Denoting this value of r by $r^*$ , we must solve\\\\\n $2.5A(2.1,2.5)e^{-B(2.1,2.5)r^*}+102.5A(2.1,3.0)e^{-B(2.1,3.0)r^*} = 99$, where the A and B functions are given by equation <ans_image_1> and <ans_image_2>. \\\\\n In this case, A(2.1,2.5) = 0.999732, A(2.1,3.0) = 0.998656, B(2.1,2.5) = 0.396027, and B(2.1,3.0) = 0.88005. and Solver shows that $r^* = 0.066244$. Since $2.5A(2.1,2.5)e^{-B(2.1,2.5)*r^*} = 2.434614$ and $102.5A(2.1,3.0)e^{-B(2.1,3.0)*r^*} = 96.56539$\\\\\n the call option on the coupon-bearing bond can be decomposed into a call option with a strike price of 2.434614 on a bond that pays off 2.5 at time 2.5 years and a call option with a strike price of 96.56539 on a bond that pays off 102.5 at time 3.0 years.\n The options are valued using <ans_image_3>\\\\\n For the first option, $L = 2.5, K = 2.434614, T = 2.1, $and $s = 2.5$. Also, P(0,T) = exp(-0.059118*2.1) = 0.88325 and P(0,s) = exp(-0.059118*2.5) = 0.862609. \\\\\n Furthermore, $\\sigma_P = 0.008176$ and $h = 0.353374$, so that the option price is 0.010523.\\\\\n For the second option, $L = 102.5, K = 96.56539, T = 2.1, $and $s = 3.0$. Also, P(0,T) = exp(-0.059118*2.1) = 0.88325 and P(0,s) = exp(-0.059118*3.0) = 0.837484. \\\\\n Furthermore, $\\sigma_P = 0.018168$ and $h = 0.363366$, so that the option price is 0.934074.\\\\\n The total value of the option is therefore 0.010523+0.934074 = 0.944596.",

        "context": "William Azarov是资产管理公司Westcome Investments的投资组合经理。Azarov正在筹备与Westcome的两位客户会面，并得到了初级分析师Jason Boulder的协助。第一场会面的对象是Maglav Inc.，这是一家快速发展的美国科技公司，员工队伍年轻且人员流动率高。Azarov指示Boulder审查Maglav公司固定收益（DB）养老金计划的细节。该计划资金充裕，管理的资产规模达2500万美元。Boulder提出以下两点观察：\n观察1：Maglav的股东从该计划的资金充裕状态中受益。\n观察2：如果员工流动率下降，Maglav养老金计划的资金比率将会降低。\nMaglav将养老金计划的管理完全外包给了Westcome Investments。费用结构要求Maglav无论业绩如何，都要向Westcome支付高额的基本费用。Boulder告诉Azarov，外包为像Maglav养老金计划这样的小型机构投资者带来以下三项好处：\n好处1：监管要求降低。\n好处2：委托代理问题引发的利益冲突得以消除。\n好处3：投资者通过规模效益能够接触到更广泛的投资策略。\n在与Maglav的会面中，Azarov介绍了Westcome在管理养老金计划时所采用的投资方法。该方法的特点是对另类投资的配置比例较高、进行大量积极管理，并且依赖于将资产外包给其他外部资产管理公司。Azarov还解释说，Maglav的经营业绩与养老金资产回报的相关性较低，而且由于养老基金资产在Maglav市值中所占比例较小，这一事实也影响了投资策略。Azarov表示，该计划受1974年《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA）约束，并遵循公认会计原则，包括《会计准则编码》（ASC）715“薪酬——退休福利”。\nAzarov的第二场会面是与Wolf University Endowment Fund（该基金）的首席投资官John Spintop。Spintop聘请Westcome协助制定一项新的投资政策，以提交给基金董事会。该基金管理的资产规模为2亿美元，总体目标是在为Wolf University提供必要财务支持的同时，维持长期购买力。在会面中，Spintop表示，该基金有一项年度支出政策，即向Wolf University支付基金三年滚动资产价值的4%，并且基金的风险承受能力应考虑以下三项负债特征：\n特征1：该基金能够轻松进入债务市场。\n特征2：该基金支持Wolf University年度预算的10%。\n特征3：该基金每年从馈赠和捐赠中获得大量资金流入。\n该基金的投资人员规模较小，在管理另类资产方面经验有限，目前采用挪威模式作为投资方法。Azarov建议改变投资方法，对外部管理的另类资产（即对冲基金和私募股权）进行配置。各类资产类别的十年名义预期回报假设，以及三项包括对另类资产部分配置的拟议资产配置方案，列示于表1。\n<image_1>\n预计未来10年的年通货膨胀率为2.5%。 ",

        "explanation": "答案选 C 是正确的。两项观察都正确。对于企业固定收益养老金计划而言，Maglav 的股东是利益相关者。这些利益相关者关注养老金计划的可持续性，而资金充裕状态是资产负债表上的一项资产，有可能提升 Maglav 股票的价值。资金充裕状态还使得管理层有可能降低雇主对该计划的缴款，从而增加净收益。它还降低了财务风险，这可能会减少股价波动。此外，员工流动率降低会增加计划负债，使资金比率恶化。人员流动率高时，获得既定养老金权益并有权领取固定收益养老金的员工会减少。相反，如果员工流动率降低，预期的既定养老金权益人数将会增加，从而导致计划负债增加，资金比率降低。",

Elle et deux de ses collègues, Peg Todd et Nat Filbert, viennent de rejoindre le comité d'investissement interne qui supervise le processus d'investissement du plan de prestations définies de Stone. En tant qu'équipe, ils aideront le comité d'investissement à mesurer le rendement global, à envisager des indices de référence et à évaluer les gestionnaires de placements externes. Todd initie une discussion sur l'utilisation des indices de référence applicables à divers gestionnaires de fonds, y compris les fonds de couverture.\n\nTodd :\n« Nous devrions associer les gestionnaires passifs et actifs à l'indice de marché approprié. Tout indice de référence ou indice que nous utilisons doit répondre aux besoins spécifiques du sponsor (Stone Bancorp) plutôt qu'à ceux du gestionnaire. De plus, à l'exclusion des fonds de couverture, les indices doivent être largement disponibles. »\n\nFilbert :\n« Un indice de référence approprié aura des risques similaires à ceux du portefeuille d'un gestionnaire actif, ce qui nous permettra de mieux identifier et réduire l'exposition aux risques actifs. Si les niveaux de risque de l'indice de référence et du gestionnaire sont alignés, nous sommes indifférents à savoir si les rendements excédentaires positifs sont obtenus par compétence ou par chance. »\n\nMishum :\n« Pour les portefeuilles d'actions actives, nous devrions au moins pouvoir attribuer les rendements à la sélection des titres ou aux paris sectoriels. »\n\nL'équipe de Mishum examine les résumés des rapports des résultats globaux récents du compte du plan de retraite (Exhibit 1) et la performance des gestionnaires de portefeuilles d'actions (Exhibit 2). Le compte a connu des flux de trésorerie significatifs seulement en avril et en décembre.\n\n<image_1>\n\nEn utilisant les données de l'Exhibit 1, Filbert calcule un rendement annuel global de -2,2% tandis que Mishum calcule un rendement de -1,8% pour l'année. L'équipe vérifie les calculs de rendement et discute des raisons pour lesquelles ils diffèrent :\n\nMishum :\n« Lors de l'évaluation des rendements des projets avec des flux de trésorerie, on m'a appris à utiliser le taux de rendement interne (TRI). Il tient compte des flux de trésorerie mais n'est pas influencé par leur calendrier. »\n\nFilbert :\n« Vous avez calculé le taux de rendement pondéré dans le temps (TRPT), tandis que j'ai calculé le taux de rendement pondéré par les montants (TRPM). »\n\nTodd :\n« Le rendement pondéré par les montants devrait dépasser le rendement pondéré dans le temps parce que les flux de trésorerie se sont produits à des moments favorables. »\n\nL'équipe considère ensuite la performance des gestionnaires de portefeuilles d'actions de l'année précédente.\n\nAprès avoir examiné les données des gestionnaires de portefeuilles d'actions dans l'Exhibit 2, Todd commente qu'il est le plus impressionné par le gestionnaire dont le rendement actif était le plus élevé pour ceux dont le style d'investissement était défavorable au cours de la période.\n\nSix mois plus tard, Stone Bancorp annonce une fusion avec une autre banque. Lorsque l'accord sera conclu, Stone gèlera et mettra fin au plan de retraite à prestations définies existant. Les employés auront accès à un plan différent avec le nouveau propriétaire. Le sponsor précise les obligations de retraite après ces événements comme suit :\n\nAucun nouvel employé ne sera ajouté au plan et les employés existants ne cumuleront plus de bénéfices supplémentaires.\nLes bénéficiaires retraités actuels continueront à recevoir leurs paiements mensuels fixes habituels. Ils n'ont pas d'option pour une distribution en capital.\nEn raison des résiliations prévues, y compris certains cadres très bien rémunérés, les distributions en capital au cours de l'année prochaine sont estimées à environ 15% de la valeur actuelle du plan.\nLe plan sera financé à 105% de l'ABO lors de sa résiliation et aucune contribution future supplémentaire n'est attendue.\nLes actuaires identifient la durée des paiements estimés, à l'exclusion des distributions en capital, à 14 ans.\nLe rendement estimé nécessaire pour répondre aux obligations du plan est de 3,9%.\nMishum, Filbert et Todd évaluent la nouvelle situation de Stone et travaillent à la mise en place d'un nouvel indice de référence qui imite les obligations et les risques du plan résilié à l'avenir. La structure de l'indice de référence guidera le réalignement des investissements.\n\nMishum :\n« Nous devrions concevoir un indice de référence qui inclut plusieurs fonds obligataires, quelques titres sensibles à l'inflation, avec une durée moyenne pondérée de 14 ans, et une liquidité suffisante pour répondre aux distributions en capital. »\n\nTodd :\n« Je pense que nous devrions identifier un rendement requis de 3,9% comme objectif principal, car cette estimation inclut tous les paiements prévus, y compris les ajustements pour l'inflation. Nous sélectionnons ensuite un assortiment de classes d'actifs qui répondent à ce rendement requis tout en minimisant le risque autant que possible. »\n\nFilbert :\n« Bien que vous ayez tous deux de bons arguments, l'accent principal devrait être mis sur l'analyse de style Sharpe. Nous devrions contrôler le risque d'investissement en utilisant des procédures d'optimisation. »\n\n<image_2>\n\n",

        "context": "Kingsbridge Partners, basé à Londres, a été sélectionné pour gérer un portefeuille obligataire mondial de 150 millions de GBP pour un fonds de pension. Jonathan Bixby, gestionnaire de portefeuille chez Kingsbridge, rencontre Iain Seymour, analyste en revenu fixe de l'entreprise, pour examiner le portefeuille et ses avoirs par rapport aux objectifs du client.\n\nLe fonds de pension autorise l'utilisation de 100 % de levier pour générer des rendements incrémentaux. Bixby évalue l'utilisation du levier dans le portefeuille en utilisant les données de l'Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nLa vue macroéconomique actuelle de Bixby est que l'économie croît à un rythme supérieur à la tendance et, par conséquent, les taux d'intérêt devraient probablement augmenter. Étant donné son point de vue, il s'inquiète que la duration du portefeuille soit inappropriée et prévoit d'utiliser le marché des contrats à terme pour gérer le risque de taux d'intérêt. Son nouvel objectif de duration pour le portefeuille d'actifs est de 4,25, et il utilise les données de l'Exhibit 2 pour repositionner le portefeuille.\n\n<image_2>\n\nSeymour suggère à Bixby qu'en alternative aux contrats à terme, il pourrait utiliser des swaps de taux d'intérêt ou des options pour modifier la duration du portefeuille. Il dit qu'il peut modifier la duration en recevant un taux fixe et en payant un taux variable sur un swap. Seymour suggère également que l'achat d'une option de vente protectrice permettra d'atteindre l'objectif de couverture mais offrira davantage de potentiel haussier si Bixby se trompe sur la direction future des taux d'intérêt. Il dit que Bixby peut également exprimer son point de vue en écrivant un call couvert et ne pas supporter le coût de la prime.\n\nSeymour dit à Bixby : « Les taux d'intérêt internationaux ne sont pas parfaitement corrélés. Nous pouvons voir l'impact d'un changement des taux d'intérêt américains sur notre portefeuille obligataire mondial modèle. Ce portefeuille contient des obligations américaines et allemandes et n'est actuellement pas couvert en ce qui concerne les devises ou les taux d'intérêt. Notre analyse montre que le bêta de pays entre les États-Unis et l'Allemagne est de 0,62. » Les données du portefeuille obligataire mondial modèle sont fournies dans l'Exhibit 3.\n\n<image_3>\n\nBixby demande à Seymour si le portefeuille modèle devrait être couvert par rapport à sa devise nationale, la livre sterling (GBP). Bixby lui dit que la gestion active du risque de change est une source attendue de rendements incrémentaux pour le portefeuille et a historiquement représenté 25 % de l'alpha de Kingsbridge par rapport à l'indice de référence. Seymour se réfère aux données de l'Exhibit 4 pour soutenir son point de vue actuel selon lequel l'exposition à la devise dans le portefeuille devrait être gérée activement.\n\n<image_4>\n\nBixby demande si ce portefeuille mondial bénéficierait de l'inclusion de titres de dette des marchés émergents. Seymour répond que les rendements peuvent être attractifs dans les marchés émergents pendant certaines périodes, mais les risques sont également nombreux. Il note les risques suivants :\nRisque 1 : Les rendements sont souvent caractérisés par une forte asymétrie négative parce que le potentiel de baisse importante n'est pas compensé par un potentiel de hausse comparable.\nRisque 2 : Les marchés émergents offrent moins de protection contre les ingérences de l'exécutif que les pays développés.\nRisque 3 : Les pays des marchés émergents ont un accès limité aux sources secondaires de liquidité.",

Elle transmet les demandes à Vladimir Norsk, l'un des traders de la société. La première transaction qu'Ahmed demande à Norsk d'exécuter est l'achat de 2 000 actions de BDF Ltd., qui se négocie sur le SEAQ, le marché des actions peu échangées de Londres. Norsk examine le carnet d'ordres à cours limité actuel pour BDF montré dans l'Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nNorsk a pu remplir l'ordre pour BDF pendant la journée en exécutant les transactions montrées dans l'Exhibit 2.\n\n<image_2>\n\nLa demande suivante qu'Ahmed examine concerne l'achat de 300 000 actions de WWT pie par un client qui est très préoccupé par l'exécution des prix.

Deux jours plus tard, Norsk achète avec succès 800 actions de JAK à 26,25 £ avec des frais de commission de 135,00 £. Moore décide d'annuler la commande des 200 actions restantes lorsque les actions ferment ce jour-là à 26,75 £.\n\nMoore et Ahmed discutent du manque à gagner lié à l'investissement dans JAK, basé sur le prix de clôture de 25,50 $ dans l'Exhibit 3, et Moore fait la déclaration suivante :\nJe sais que le mouvement du marché est un facteur dans le manque à gagner. Étant donné que le mouvement du marché échappe au contrôle de Norsk, lors de l'évaluation de sa performance, nous devrions ajuster le calcul pour ne prendre en compte que les frais de commission et la perte d'opportunité de négociation pour les 200 actions.”",

Étant donné que l'ordre représente une portion importante du volume quotidien de WWT (450 000 actions, voir Exhibit 2) et pourrait affecter le prix, ce qui est important pour le client, Moore utiliserait probablement un ordre iceberg. Un ordre iceberg est un ordre à cours limité avec des instructions pour afficher uniquement une portion de l'ordre à la fois, afin d'éviter de faire bouger le prix du marché de manière défavorable. Une transaction principale ne serait pas appropriée car elle nécessite souvent des concessions sur le prix, et le prix est important dans cette situation.",

        "context": "Gregory Dodson est un consultant en investissement qui conseille des clients individuels et institutionnels sur leurs portefeuilles d'actions. Au cours d'une semaine de travail typique, il est amené à évaluer une variété de situations et à fournir des conseils d'expert. Cette semaine, il rencontre trois clients.\n\nLa première réunion de Dodson est avec la Magnolia Foundation, une petite organisation à but non lucratif. Magnolia utilise actuellement trois gestionnaires de portefeuille uniquement à long terme pour ses investissements en actions. Les détails de ces investissements, y compris la performance attendue par rapport à l'indice de référence en actions de Magnolia, l'indice S&P 500, sont montrés dans l'Exhibit 1.\n\n<image_1>\n\nL'objectif de Magnolia pour son investissement total en actions est un alpha attendu supérieur à 0,40 % et une erreur de suivi attendue inférieure à 1,00 %.\n\nLa deuxième réunion de Dodson est avec Sarah Tan, une personne riche qui est activement impliquée dans la gestion de ses investissements. Tan souhaite ajouter une allocation de 100 millions de dollars aux actions moyennes américaines, représentées par l'indice S&P 400 Midcap des États-Unis, à son allocation d'actifs à long terme. Aucun investissement n'a été effectué pour atteindre cette nouvelle allocation.\n\nTan n'a pas trouvé de gestionnaire capable de générer un alpha positif dans les actions moyennes américaines. Elle a cependant identifié un gestionnaire de portefeuille uniquement à long terme en actions canadiennes qu'elle croit capable de produire un alpha positif. Ce gestionnaire utilise l'indice S&P/TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) comme indice de référence. Tan souhaite créer une stratégie d'alpha portable qui gagnera l'alpha du portefeuille d'actions canadiennes et répondra à la nouvelle allocation d'indice aux actions moyennes américaines. Elle demande à Dodson des conseils pour établir cette stratégie. Tan fournit quelques informations sur les méthodes de sélection des titres utilisées par le gestionnaire de portefeuille canadien. Le gestionnaire canadien utilise un modèle propriétaire d'actualisation des flux de trésorerie pour analyser toutes les actions de l'indice S&P/TSX et achète celles dont les prix de marché sont les plus inférieurs à la valeur intrinsèque estimée par son modèle, indépendamment de leurs ratios cours/bénéfice (P/E).\n\nLa troisième réunion de Dodson est avec le directeur des investissements (CIO) du fonds de pension de Susquehanna Industries. Le fonds doit établir un portefeuille de 50 millions de dollars qui réplique l'indice Russell 2000, un indice des actions de petite capitalisation des États-Unis. L'objectif du CIO est de minimiser les coûts de transaction. Il demande à Dodson de proposer une approche d'investissement qui répondra à cet objectif. Le CIO décrit également la discipline de vente des gestionnaires de portefeuille en ce qui concerne les portefeuilles d'actions de valeur et de croissance gérés activement du fonds de pension. Actuellement, les gestionnaires surveillent le P/E de chaque action détenue. Une action de valeur est vendue lorsque son P/E atteint sa moyenne historique de 10 ans. Une action de croissance est vendue lorsque son P/E tombe à sa moyenne historique de 10 ans.",

Le tableau 1.3 fait de même pour les options de vente (put) sur Apple à cette même date. Les cotations proviennent du site web du CBOE.\n\nLe prix de l'action Apple au moment des cotations était bid : 316,23 $ et ask : 316,50 $. L'écart bid-ask pour une option (en pourcentage du prix) est généralement beaucoup plus important que pour l'action sous-jacente et dépend du volume des transactions.\n\nLes prix d'exercice des options dans les tableaux 1.2 et 1.3 sont 290 $, 300 $, 310 $, 320 $, 330 $ et 340 $. Les échéances sont en juin 2020, septembre 2020 et décembre 2020. Le jour précis d'expiration est le troisième vendredi du mois d'échéance.

Ce prix correspond à une option pour acheter une action. Aux États-Unis, un contrat d’option porte sur 100 actions. Par conséquent, le trader doit prévoir 2 030 $ pour cette transaction, montant qui sera transféré à l’autre partie via le courtier et la bourse.\n\nDans cet exemple, le trader a obtenu, pour un coût de 2 030 $, le droit d’acheter 100 actions Apple à 340 $ chacune.\n\nSi le prix d’Apple ne dépasse pas 340 $ d’ici le 18 décembre 2020, que se passera-t-il ?",

Au temps zéro, nous avons une action dont le prix par action est noté $S_0$, une quantité positive connue au temps zéro. Au temps un, le prix par action de cette action prendra l'une des deux valeurs positives, que nous notons $S_1(H)$ et $S_1(T)$, H et T représentant respectivement face et pile. Ainsi, nous imaginons qu'une pièce est lancée et que le résultat du lancer détermine le prix au temps un. Nous ne supposons pas que cette pièce est équitable (c'est-à-dire que la probabilité de face n'est pas nécessairement de un demi). Nous supposons uniquement que la probabilité de face, que nous appelons p, est positive, et que la probabilité de pile, $q = 1 - p$, est également positive.\n\nLe résultat du lancer de pièce, et donc la valeur que prendra le prix de l'action au temps un, est connu au temps un mais pas au temps zéro. Nous appellerons aléatoire toute quantité non connue au temps zéro, car elle dépend de l'expérience aléatoire du lancer de pièce. Nous introduisons les deux nombres positifs $u = \\frac{S_1(H)}{S_0}, \\quad d = \\frac{S_1(T)}{S_0}$. Nous supposons que $d < u$. Nous appelons u le facteur de hausse et d le facteur de baisse.\n\nNous introduisons également un taux d'intérêt r. Un dollar investi sur le marché monétaire au temps zéro rapportera $1 + r$ dollars au temps un. Inversement, un dollar emprunté sur le marché monétaire au temps zéro entraînera une dette de $1 + r$ dollars au temps un. En particulier, le taux d'intérêt pour emprunter est le même que celui pour investir. Il est presque toujours vrai que $r > 0$, et c'est le cas à garder à l'esprit.\n\nUne caractéristique essentielle d'un marché efficient est que si une stratégie de trading peut transformer rien en quelque chose, nous pouvons être sûrs qu'il existe une possibilité de perte. Sinon, il y aurait une arbitrage. Plus précisément, nous définissons l'arbitrage comme une stratégie de trading qui commence sans argent, a une probabilité nulle de perdre de l'argent et une probabilité positive d'en gagner.

Les deux autres inégalités découlent de l’absence d’arbitrage, comme nous l’expliquons maintenant. Si $ d \\geq 1 + r $, on pourrait commencer avec une richesse nulle et au moment zéro, emprunter sur le marché monétaire, une action à la fois vaudra encore plus. Même dans le pire des cas d'un tirage au sort, le stock au premier moment sera suffisamment élevé pour rembourser la dette du marché monétaire et aura toujours une probabilité positive de valoir strictement plus puisque $ d \\geq 1 + r $. Cela fournit un arbitrage. D'un autre côté, si $ u \\leq 1 + r $, on pourrait vendre l'action à découvert et investir le produit sur le marché monétaire. Même dans le meilleur des cas pour le titre, le coût de son remplacement au premier moment sera inférieur ou égal à la valeur de l'investissement sur le marché monétaire, et puisque $ d < u \\leq 1 + r $, il existe une probabilité positive que le coût de remplacement des actions sera strictement inférieur à la valeur de l'investissement sur le marché monétaire.

Ce n'est pas surprenant, puisque c'est exactement le coût de la réplication de $S_1$.\nCela illustre un point important. Le « juste prix » d’une action ne peut pas être déterminé par une tarification neutre au risque, comme indiqué ci-dessous. Supposons que $S_1(H)$ et $S_1(T)$ soient donnés, nous pourrions avoir deux prix courants, $S_0$ et $S'_0$. En conséquence, nous pouvons obtenir $u$, $d$ et $u'$, $d'$. Parce qu'ils sont déterminés respectivement par $S_0$ et $S'_0$, il n'est pas surprenant que la formule de tarification sans risque soit toujours valable, dans les deux cas. C'est,\n$$S_0=\\frac{\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}S_1(H)+\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d}S_1(T)}{1+r}, S'_0\\equiv\\frac{\\frac{1+r-d'}{u'-d'}S_1(H)+\\frac{u'-1-r}{u'-d'}S_1(T )}{1+r}.$$\nCela est essentiellement dû au fait que la tarification sans risque repose sur un prix équitable = coût de réplication. L’action en tant que composant réplicatif ne peut pas déterminer son propre prix « juste » via la formule de tarification sans risque.\n\n\"",
